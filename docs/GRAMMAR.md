# Nirdosha — grammar

Scope: the "Core language" slice from `docs/goal.md` §3/§6, plus Phase 1's first
increment — `box`/`*` and the ownership discipline they make meaningful
(`crates/compiler/src/ownership.rs`) — plus a first slice of concurrency (rows
2–3): `spawn`/`join`/`thread T` (real OS threads; see `docs/PHASE0.md`'s
"Eleventh update") and `chan`/`send`/`recv` (see its "Twelfth update") —
plus a first slice of `docs/SANDBOXING.md`'s sandboxing extension: `sandbox`/
`stop` (an affine handle around a real, separate OS process; see
`docs/PHASE0.md`'s "Thirteenth update"), `chan` wired to a real cross-process
transport for sandboxed processes ("Fourteenth update"), and `str`/`tcp`/
`connect` (a real TCP client — the prerequisite for orchestrating an
*arbitrary* containerized workload, not just another Nirdosha process;
see `docs/PHASE0.md`'s "Fifteenth update"), plus Row 11
(`docs/nirdosha_row11_amendment.md`) — `struct`/`enum` declarations (with
type-parameter lists — layer 6, generics: `Pair(A, B)`), `match`,
`expr.field` access, and the `Option(T)`/`Result(T, E)` prelude (layer
7), injected into every program at parse time — plus Row 12's `screen`/
`dashboard` declarative UI DSL (docs/LANGUAGE.md §11), consumed only by
`nirdosha emit-ui`/`nirdosha serve`. Note that
`spawn`/`join`/`thread`/`chan`/`send`/`recv`/`sandbox`/`stop` are, so
far, interpreter-only — `codegen.rs` rejects them explicitly, the same
"reject, don't mis-compile" treatment `box`/`&` (and, later,
`str`/`tcp`/`connect`) got before *their* own codegen support existed.
`box`/`&`/`*`, `str`, `tcp`/`connect`/`listen`/`accept`/`send`/`recv` (the
`tcp` case of the last two, not the `chan` one), and — as of Phase 4a —
`struct`/`enum`/`match` over **non-affine** payloads are **compiled** now
(an affine-containing `struct`/`enum`/`match` — a `box`/`&`/`tcp`/`file`/
`db`/`mq` field, transitively — is the one still-rejected Row 11 case,
Phase 4b; see `docs/LANGUAGE.md` §10). See `docs/LANGUAGE.md` §10 for the current,
verified list; this file only tracks grammar scope, not
compiled-vs-interpreter status, so check §10 directly rather than inferring
it from this paragraph's history. `screen`/`dashboard` are different in kind, not just degree:
`codegen.rs` never inspects `Program.screens`/`.dashboard` at all (there's
no expression inside either for it to walk), so `nirdosha build`/
`emit-llvm` compile a program containing them cleanly — the declarations
are simply inert to codegen, not rejected by it.

## Row 7 claim, stated precisely

The parser (`crates/compiler/src/parser.rs`) is hand-written recursive descent with
**strictly one token of lookahead and no backtracking**, anywhere. That is
the operational definition of LL(1): at every point, the next token alone
determines which production applies. Binary-operator precedence is handled
by precedence climbing inside expression parsing, not by grammar
left-recursion — which is what keeps the expression grammar LL(1)-parseable
without a separate transformation step.

**Update — now cross-checked, and the check found something real.**
`crates/grammar_check/` (a separate crate; see its README for the full story) ran
this grammar through `lalrpop`, an independent LALR(1) generator. It does
not build cleanly, and the reason is worth stating as a rule rather than
leaving buried in a build log: **this language has no statement
separator — no semicolons, no significant newlines — so wherever an
operator token could either extend the current expression or start a new
statement, the grammar is genuinely ambiguous as a plain CFG.** The
parser resolves every one of these cases the same deterministic way —
**always prefer to extend the current expression over ending the
statement** (equivalently: shift over reduce, always) — but that rule
was previously implicit in `parser.rs`'s control flow only, never stated
here. It's real and load-bearing: `return x` immediately followed on the
next line by `-y`, with nothing between them, parses as `return (x - y)`
— one statement, a subtraction — not as `return x` followed by a
separate `-y` statement, checked directly against the running
interpreter (`crates/grammar_check/README.md` has the transcript). Every
`stmt ::= ...` alternative below should be read with this rule attached,
not as free-standing productions a parser could combine in whatever
order first succeeds.

This is the LALR(1) claim's honest final form: the *hand-written parser*
is unambiguous (deterministic, single-token lookahead, no backtracking —
the original claim above still holds, and still matters for row 7). The
*grammar as an abstract CFG*, independent of any particular parser
implementing it, is not unambiguous without this rule stated explicitly
— a distinction that only became visible by actually running a second,
independent tool against it, not by re-reading the hand-written parser
more carefully.

## EBNF

**Disambiguation rule this EBNF alone doesn't state** (found by the
LALR(1) cross-check above, not designed in up front): a `block`'s
`stmt*` (below) has no separator between statements. Wherever a token
could either extend the previous statement's expression or begin a new
statement, **always extend the previous one** — shift over reduce, with
no exception. Two concrete cases, the simplest one first:

```
let x: i64 = 1
-2
```
parses as one statement, `let x: i64 = (1 - 2)` (`x` is `-1`) — never as
`let x: i64 = 1` followed by a separate `-2` expression-statement.

```
return x
-y
```
parses as `return (x - y)` — one statement, a subtraction — never as
`return x` followed by a separate `-y` statement.

// keyword, is what produces a `tcp` value — see `unary` below), so it
// didn't need `sandbox`'s dual-use token treatment either.
// `Vector`/`Matrix` are deliberately capitalized, unlike every lowercase
// scalar `TypeName` — a genuinely different production (both take `(...)`
// arguments: an element type plus one or two fixed dimensions), not
// another bare keyword, and the surface syntax the unified plan's
// architecture table already uses (`Matrix(f64, 3, 3)`). Dimensions are
// plain integer literals, not arbitrary expressions — "Sized by Default"
// (the plan's §2) means the shape is fixed at compile time, the same way
// every other `type` production here is a closed grammar, not a runtime
// value.
// `ident` and `ident "(" type ("," type)* ")"` (last two alternatives)
// are Row 11's addition to this production — a declared `struct`/`enum`
// name, optionally applied to concrete type arguments (layer 6,
// generics: `Pair(i64, str)`, the same "type name applied to arguments"
// shape `Vector(T, N)`/`Matrix(T, R, C)` already use — deliberately, to
// avoid `<...>`-style type application: Nirdosha never uses it anywhere,
// and introducing it here would be the one genuinely new source of
// parsing ambiguity in an otherwise LL(1) grammar, the same "turbofish"
// problem this reuse sidesteps — `docs/nirdosha_row11_amendment.md` §3.1).
// Accepted syntactically for *any* identifier here (the parser has no
// declaration table to check against — `docs/LANGUAGE.md` §6's "functions are
// looked up by name in a table" applies equally to types now); an
// identifier that doesn't actually name a real struct/enum is
// `TypeErrorKind::UnknownType`, and a real one applied to the wrong
// number of type arguments is `TypeErrorKind::WrongTypeArity` — both
// caught by `typeck.rs`, not this grammar.
// `fn(T1, T2) -> R` (last alternative) -- a first-class function value's
// type, e.g. `apply(f: fn(i64) -> i64, x: i64)` (`examples/

// Right-associative, lowest precedence among non-`if` expressions — same

// that lets a general expression (`foo.bar`, `foo[0]`, ...) appear as an
// assignment target. **Corrected, since both now exist as plain
// expressions (postfix's `[...]`/`.ident` above), unlike when this note
// was first written:** `foo[0] = x`/`foo.bar = x` are still rejected —
// `parse_assignment` parses the left side as a full `logic_or` (see the

// an `Expr::Ident`; an `Expr::Index`/`Expr::FieldAccess` there is
// `"left-hand side of \`=\` must be a plain variable name"`, checked
// directly. Widening `assignment`'s left side to either is a real
// grammar change this document would need to update, not just a parser
// one, if it's ever done.
//
// Implementation note, distinct from the grammar restriction above: the
// parser doesn't try `ident "="` as a distinct alternative (that would
// need two tokens of lookahead at the start). It parses a full
// `logic_or` first — which for a bare name yields an `Ident` expression
// — and only *then* checks whether the current token is `=` and the
// thing it just built was exactly an `Ident`. That's still a
// single-token decision at the point the decision is made; it just
// happens after, not before, parsing the left side. If the grammar
// restriction above ever widens, this parsing technique doesn't
// automatically follow — it would need its own redesign.

// *only* sensible meaning of `+`/`-` for two matching-shape operands, so
// a dotted spelling would just be a redundant second name for the same
// operation `+`/`-` already do.
multiplicative ::= unary (("*" | "/" | ".*" | "./") unary)*
// `*` is unary deref here, not multiplication — `multiplicative` only ever
// sees `*` in infix position, after a full `unary` is already parsed, so
// there's no ambiguity: which meaning applies is determined purely by
// which production is asking, never by extra lookahead.
//
// `box`/`*`/`!`/`-` all apply to a full `unary`, not just a `primary` —
// so `box f()` boxes the *result of calling* `f`, `*g()` dereferences a
// call's result, and so on. This is intentional, not a surprising
// consequence of the grammar's shape: `box`/`&` wrap an arbitrary
// expression (see `Expr::Box`/`Expr::Ref` in ast.rs — neither is
// restricted to a `Primary` operand), the same way `!`/`-` do. `box`
// specifically is not a type constructor with special primary-only
// syntax the way it might read in some languages; it's an ordinary
// prefix operator over expressions.
//
// `&expr`'s operand is restricted, after parsing, to exactly `Expr::Ident`
// — see `Expr::Ref`'s doc comment in ast.rs for why. Two independent,
// separately-checked limitations stack here, not one: (1) `&&x` lexes as
// one `AndAnd` token (needed for the boolean operator), so a
// reference-to-a-reference can't even be *written* with `&&` — the same
// ambiguity early C-family lexers have historically had. (2) Writing it
// with a space instead (`& &x`) *does* lex as two separate `&` tokens —
// checked directly (`& &n` for `n: i64` produces two `Amp` tokens, not
// one `AndAnd`) — but is *still* rejected, by the Ident-only operand
// restriction just above: `&x`'s own operand is `Expr::Ref(...)`, not a
// bare `Expr::Ident`, so parsing fails with "`&` can only borrow a plain
// variable name" regardless of the lexer question. Fixing the lexer
// wouldn't be enough on its own to make `& &x` legal; both limitations
// would need to be addressed together.
// `spawn`'s operand is restricted, after parsing, to exactly `Expr::Call`
// — the same "parse normally, then validate what came out" technique
// `&`'s `Expr::Ident` restriction above uses. `spawn` runs a *named
// function*, not an arbitrary expression, so `spawn f()()` (were it even
// legal — see `call`'s own arity restriction below) or `spawn (1 + 2)`
// are both rejected with a specific message, not a generic parse error.
// `chan` takes no operand at all — it's a nullary keyword in expression
// position (see `Expr::Chan` in ast.rs for why: unlike `box`/`spawn`, it
// has no sub-expression to infer a payload type from, so it only
// type-checks against an already-known `chan T` expectation).
// `send`/`recv` don't fit this file's "prefix keyword wraps a `unary`"
// shape at all — `send` needs *two* operands (the channel, the payload),
// so both use an explicit, fixed-arity `"(" ... ")"` form instead, closer
// in shape to `call` below than to `spawn`/`join`.
// `sandbox`'s operand restriction is identical to `spawn`'s (`Expr::Call`
// only, same "parse then validate" technique) — `sandbox worker(x)`
// launches a *named function* as a real OS process, not an arbitrary
// expression. `stop`'s operand is an unrestricted `unary`, exactly like
// `join` — both consume a handle-typed expression (a `sandbox` *or* a
// `tcp` connection — `stop` was reused rather than inventing a second
// word that would mean the same "one-time consuming close" thing) and
// don't care how it was produced (an `Ident`, a nested `stop`/`join`,
// etc.). `send`/`recv` are likewise reused for `tcp`, not given their
// own second production — same fixed two-/one-operand shape either way,
// dispatched on the first operand's type, not the grammar. `connect`
// fits the same fixed-arity `"(" ... ")"` shape `send` already
// established, just under its own keyword (it's not consuming an
// existing handle the way `send`/`recv`/`stop` are — it *produces* one).

## Deliberate omissions (Phase 0 boundary, not forgotten)

- No `for` loop yet — `while` is the one structured-iteration primitive
  until the design decides whether `for` is sugar over `while` (compositional,
  row 8) or a separate construct (simpler to read, row 6). Undecided on
  purpose rather than guessed.
- **Superseded, kept for history:** this used to say "no general
  structs/enums yet — `type` is still a closed grammar, not open to
  user-defined names." Row 11 (`docs/nirdosha_row11_amendment.md`) changed
  that: `struct_decl`/`enum_decl`/`match_expr` above are real,
  interpreter-checked and -executed (`typeck.rs`, `ownership.rs`,
  `interpreter.rs`), through layer 6 of that amendment's own rollout —
  including generics (`struct Pair(A, B) { .. }`, `type_param_list`
  above) with real structural-per-instantiation type identity
  (`Pair(i64, str)` and `Pair(f64, bool)` are different, unrelated
  `Ty`s — no monomorphizer pass exists or is needed; see
  `ast::substitute_ty`) and the `Option(T)`/`Result(T, E)` prelude
  (layer 7 — `ast::prelude_enums`, injected into every program at parse
  time, no special-casing anywhere downstream). `Vector`/`Matrix` (dense,
  fixed-shape 1-D/2-D arrays — `type`'s `"Vector" "(" ... ")"`/
  `"Matrix" "(" ... ")"` productions above) remain a separate, older
  mechanism, not unified with `struct`/`enum` — what's still missing for
  *them* specifically is dynamically-sized arrays and generic dimensions
  (`Matrix{T,N}`-style), a bigger, separate ask than Row 11 covers.
- No `unsafe`/`audited` block syntax yet — that's the Tier-3 escape valve
  from `docs/goal.md` §4, which presupposes Tier 1/2 (the SMT-discharged
  refinement layer) existing first.
- **Superseded, kept for history — split out since the original single
  paragraph made it easy to miss that two of these are real, working
  passes, not aspirations:**
  - *What used to be true:* type checking was purely dynamic (checked as
    the interpreter executed, Python-style), and assignment had "no
    ownership model, explicitly not what row 1 asks for."
  - *What's true now:* both are false. `crates/compiler/src/typeck.rs` is a
    real static pass (a program that fails it is never executed).
    `crates/compiler/src/ownership.rs` statically enforces single ownership for
    `box`-typed bindings, including branch-merge and loop-reassignment
    cases (see `docs/PHASE0.md`'s ownership updates for exactly what's proved
    and what isn't). Shared borrows (`&`) exist too — a function can
    read a value without consuming it.
  - *What's still true:* assignment (`x = expr`) reassigns any binding
    in place with no borrowing discipline applied to *it* — a scalar
    local is exactly as freely mutable as a Python local, and even a
    `box` binding can be freely reassigned (fine: reassignment isn't
    aliasing, it just clears the moved-from flag; see `ownership.rs`'s
    doc comment). `&mut` (exclusive/mutable borrows) doesn't exist yet —
    it needs real liveness tracking to enforce "aliasing xor mutability"
    that shared `&` didn't need. Reading *through* `&box T` to scalar
    content inside is also still unsupported (no place-expression
    semantics yet — see `ownership.rs`'s module doc).

### Known soundness bug, found and fixed during development

`box box i64`-style nested boxes work, but tripped a real soundness gap
while this was being built: `ownership.rs`'s first draft exempted *every*
deref from move-checking, which is only correct when what comes out is a
scalar — `*bb` for `bb: box box i64` hands out the affine inner `box i64`
by value, so it has to consume `bb`, and the first draft didn't. Fixed
(see `ownership.rs`'s `Expr::Deref` handling) and pinned by
`tests/ownership.rs::dereferencing_a_nested_box_twice_is_use_after_move`
— worth its own heading, not a trailing bullet, because it's a concrete
example of exactly the kind of bug this whole checker exists to rule
out, caught in the checker's *own* code during development, not in a
user's program.

## Independent cross-check

`crates/grammar_check/` (top-level, sibling to `compiler/` — see
[`../crates/grammar_check/README.md`](../crates/grammar_check/README.md)) runs this
EBNF through `lalrpop`, an independent LALR(1) generator, as a second
check beyond "the hand-written parser is single-token-lookahead by
construction." It's what found the statement-separator ambiguity
documented above. It does not build cleanly, on purpose and by design —
see its README for why that's the actual, informative result, not a
broken build waiting to be fixed.

## Machine-readable grammar artifact (docs/goal.md row 7)

`crates/compiler/nirdosha.gbnf` is a hand translation of this EBNF into GBNF, a
constrained-decoding grammar format — the artifact that lets an LLM's
sampler guarantee every token it emits stays inside Nirdosha's syntax,
not just hope the model learned the grammar from training data.
`crates/grammar_export/` (top-level, sibling to `compiler/` — see
[`../crates/grammar_export/README.md`](../crates/grammar_export/README.md)) is what
actually checked it: a real dependency on llama.cpp's own grammar parser
confirms the file is valid, loadable GBNF (and caught a real translation
bug — llama.cpp doesn't accept a bare `|` starting a continuation line
the way this EBNF's own visual style does), and a fidelity corpus
compares accept/reject behavior against the real lexer+parser for every
shipped example plus a set of hand-written positive/negative snippets.

**Currently failing, and not by this session's own changes**:
`nirdosha.gbnf` (119 lines) and `crates/grammar_check/src/nirdosha.lalrpop`
(182 lines) both predate Row 11 (`struct`/`enum`/`match`/generics)
entirely, and haven't caught up since — the fidelity corpus's "every
shipped example is accepted by both" test fails on `examples/
transact.nir` today, independent of and before this session's own
`screen`/`dashboard` addition (which also isn't reflected in either
file, for the same reason). Catching both files up to the compiler's
actual current grammar is effectively a from-scratch rewrite of both,
not an incremental sync; see `crates/compiler/UI_DSL_TODO.md` for the finding
in full rather than a claim, made here, that these stay in lockstep with
`docs/GRAMMAR.md` — they don't, today.
