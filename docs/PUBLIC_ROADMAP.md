# Nirdosha — Public Roadmap

A scannable, external-facing summary of what's shipped and what's next.
This is a distillation for readers deciding whether to try Nirdosha or
contribute — the full internal tracker, with verification detail and
session-by-session notes, is [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](./docs/ROADMAP.md).

Status tags: `[DONE]` (verified — tests pass or run end-to-end),
`[PARTIAL]` (real progress, gap named), `[OPEN]` (scoped, not started).

## Shipped

**Language core**
- [DONE] LL(1) grammar — hand-written parser, cross-verified against an
  independent LALR(1) generator (`crates/grammar_check/`)
- [DONE] Static type checker
- [DONE] Ownership/affine types (`box`/`&`) — no GC, no manual `free()`
- [DONE] Concurrency primitives (`spawn`/`thread`, `chan`) — compiled to
  native code (2026-09), backed by a real admission-controlled kernel;
  no mutex in the language, so a lock-order deadlock isn't expressible,
  and the one deadlock class that is (a global `chan`/`thread` stall) is
  caught by a dynamic detector and aborted, not left to hang
- [DONE] `froze` — RFC 0006 Pillar 1's `Froze<T>`, an immutable,
  freely-shareable heap handle (`box` already satisfied Pillar 1's
  `Iso<T>`)
- [DONE] `struct`/`enum`/`match`, generics, `Option(T)`/`Result(T, E)`
- [DONE] SMT-backed integer/buffer-overflow proofs (Z3), tiered with a
  runtime-guard fallback
- [DONE] Native codegen via LLVM (`-O2`) for the compiled subset —
  within 1.4× of `gcc -O2` on scalar benchmarks
- [DONE] `validate <fn_name> { pre: ... post: ... }` — real Hoare
  contracts on a function: a Z3-backed static proof that hard-fails the
  build on a genuine counterexample where it can reach one, plus an
  unconditional runtime check on every actual call as the backstop for
  everything it can't (most real functions) — see `docs/ROADMAP.md` Track F,
  F3

**Backend/services**
- [DONE] `db` (SQLite + Postgres), `json`, `http`/`https`, `mq` (Redis)
  — interpreter-only today, see Track B below
- [DONE] Identity — OIDC/JWT validation, roles/claims,
  `requires(role:...)`, an admin-editable role-mapping cache (IdP role
  names → app role names)
- [DONE] `transact` — durable transactions (WAL, crash replay, retry/
  timeout, idempotency)
- [DONE] `workflow` — durable state machines with email/SMS/push
  notification actions
- [DONE] Auto-generated, additive-only DB schema migrations

**UI engine**
- [DONE] Zero-syntax CRUD + dashboard inference from `struct`/fn naming
  conventions — no UI code needed for the common case
- [DONE] `screen`/`dashboard`/`module` DSL for the cases naming
  conventions can't express
- [DONE] Field-level RBAC (`view`/`edit` role/claim gates) and format
  validation (`pattern`/`format`/`min`/`max`) — enforced server-side,
  not just hidden in the client
- [DONE] Design-token theming (`--theme`) with live reload — color
  ramps, motion, dark-mode strategy, layout shell, all optional
- [DONE] `workspace`/`panel` — composite multi-pane screens composing
  fields/lists from several structs onto one page (`docs/LANGUAGE.md` §15)
- [DONE] `visual`/`render` — graph, heatmap, and timeline views on a
  dashboard or inside a panel, on top of the existing bar-chart-only
  `chart` (`docs/LANGUAGE.md` §11c)
- [DONE] `field { render: "countdown" }` — a live SLA countdown chip on
  a table field, ticking client-side with zero added network traffic
  (`docs/LANGUAGE.md` §11)
- [DONE] `action { show_result: true }` — a "Simulate"/"Preview" action
  shows its own JSON return value in a modal instead of just refreshing
  the row (`docs/LANGUAGE.md` §11)
- [DONE] A workflow stage stepper — a real `●━●━○━○` progress stepper
  on a workflow queue row instead of a bare state-name badge, no syntax
  change (`docs/LANGUAGE.md` §14)
- [DONE] `examples/ctms/ctms.nir` — all of the above proven together
  against a real 89-screen enterprise app spec (a Counter-Terrorism
  Financing & Transaction Monitoring System), not just in isolation —
  see `docs/ROADMAP.md` Track E6

**LLM integration**
- [DONE] LL(1) grammar exported to GBNF for constrained decoding
  (`crates/compiler/nirdosha.gbnf`)
- [DONE] Structured `Diagnostic` JSON on every error (`--format=json`)
- [DONE] `emit-ast`/`validate_fragment` for typed AST/fragment tooling
- [PARTIAL] `crates/bench/` pass@1 + self-repair-rate harness — scaffold,
  corpus, and a real `Model` (`--mode real`, any OpenAI-compatible
  `/chat/completions` endpoint) all exist; not yet run against a live
  provider for lack of an API key in this environment

## In progress / next

**Track A — Production readiness** (highest priority: gates building
critical apps on the interpreted path)
- [OPEN] `transact` durability under real kill-mid-transaction conditions
- [OPEN] A deployment story for `nirdosha serve` (containerization,
  secrets/JWKS handling)
- [PARTIAL] Observability — a local OTel-shaped tracer exists; wiring
  to a real collector (OTLP) is open
- [OPEN] A compatibility/versioning policy before the next breaking
  language change
- [PARTIAL] Identity admin console — role-mapping cache is done;
  multi-IdP registry and a roles→functions/fields report are open
- [OPEN] Real Windows verification — the compiled `tcp`/`tcp_listener`
  runtime was ported to Windows' `RawSocket` API (v0.1.0-alpha.3) but
  has never run on a real Windows machine; needs an actual test pass
- [OPEN] macOS binaries link system Z3 instead of vendoring it —
  `z3-src` 416.0.2 fails to build against current AppleClang (a real
  upstream incompatibility); revisit once a fixed `z3`/`z3-src` release
  ships

**Track B — Full compilation** (`json`/`http`/`mq`/identity/`transact`/
sandboxing remain interpreter-only; native codegen covers the numeric/
control-flow subset, `tcp`/`tcp_listener`, `file`, scalar-only native
plugin calls, `dec128` arithmetic, and, as of 2026-09, basic
concurrency — `thread`/`spawn`/`join`, `chan`/`send`/`recv`, `froze`)
- [DONE] `file` (`open`/`send`/`recv`/`stop`) — linked `nir_file_*`
  kernels, the same "declare + link a staticlib" pattern `tcp` already
  used; `examples/file_io.nir` compiles and runs as a native binary
  unchanged, verified against the interpreter's own output
  (`crates/compiler/tests/codegen.rs`)
- [DONE] Basic concurrency — `thread`/`spawn`/`join`, `chan`/`send`/
  `recv` (2026-09), plus RFC 0006 Pillar 1's `froze`. Contrary to this
  section's own earlier framing below ("not a kernel to link"), it
  shipped *as* a kernel to link: `runtime-kernels`' `nir_thread_spawn`/
  `nir_thread_join`/`nir_chan_*`, a real admission ceiling
  (`Domain::Thread`), and a dynamic global-stall deadlock detector
  (`docs/LANGUAGE.md` §7/§10, `rfcs/0007-apm-runtime-kernel.md` §8).
  Word-sized payloads/arguments/results only; `sandbox` is unaffected,
  still open below.
- [DONE] Scalar-only native plugin calls (Kind A plugins) —
  `plugin::NativePluginBuiltin`/`codegen::build_with_native_plugins`
  (`rfcs/0005-plugin-boundary-safety-and-performance.md` §3), ~250x
  faster than interpreted plugin dispatch for this subset; `str`/
  aggregate-typed plugin builtins still interpreter-only
- [DONE] The compiled-path runtime kernels (`det`/`inv`/`tcp`/`file`/...)
  moved from a bare, dependency-free `rustc` invocation to a real Cargo
  package (`crates/runtime-kernels/`, `docs/adr/0003-runtime-kernels-
  cargo-dependency.md`) that can depend on crates.io crates — the
  actual, previously-invisible reason `dec128` stayed interpreter-only
  this long: `rust_decimal` was simply unreachable from the old build.
- [PARTIAL] `dec128` — `dec_from_i64`/`dec_to_str`/`dec_round`/
  `dec_scale`, `+`/`-`/`*`/`/`, and all six comparisons compile to real
  `rust_decimal`-backed native code (`nir_dec128_*` kernels), verified
  against the interpreter byte for byte, including the division-by-zero
  trap and a `dec128` field inside a real `struct`. Only `dec_from_str`
  remains — its `.nir`-visible return type is `Result(dec128, str)`,
  and no existing compiled builtin actually constructs a real
  `Result(_, _)` enum value as its return yet (`inv`/`solve`, this
  codebase's other fallible builtins, present failure a different way)
  — a real, deliberately deferred design question, not a shortcut;
  cleanly rejected in the meantime.
- [OPEN] `transact` → `db`/`json` → `mq` → identity → `http`/`https` →
  sandboxing → first-class functions → compiled `serve` mode, roughly in
  that order. `db`/`json`/`mq` share `file`'s "linked handle-based
  kernel" shape but need a real dynamically-typed value representation
  for query results first (`Ty::Handle`'s own affine fix, `rfcs/0005`
  §1, generalizes to a `db`/`mq` connection handle for free once that
  representation exists). `sandbox` (a real, separate OS *process*, not
  a thread) remains a materially harder, separate design question from
  the concurrency work above — see `rfcs/0005` §0's own difficulty
  ranking for the fuller breakdown.

**Track C — Agent-facing HTTP API** (the spec exists —
[`docs/nirdosha-agent-api.md`](./docs/nirdosha-agent-api.md) — about half the
underlying capability already ships; the `/v1/*` server itself is 0% built)
- [OPEN] The HTTP server and its 20 endpoints across code generation,
  execution, introspection, benchmarking, and provenance

**Track D — Mobile app generation** (a second renderer of the existing
UI manifest, independent of Tracks A–C — see [`docs/MOBILE.md`](./docs/MOBILE.md))
- [OPEN] `emit-mobile` codegen scaffold — native iOS/Android from the
  same `struct`/`screen` declarations that drive the web UI today

**Track F — Next-generation language & UI architecture** (design
discussion, independent of every track above — see
[`docs/NEXT_GEN.md`](./docs/NEXT_GEN.md))
- [OPEN] A target-independent UI manifest with multiple renderers
  (web/TUI/mobile), not just today's one fixed web template
- [DONE] A real module/package system — `module Ident { ... }`
  namespacing, `pub` visibility, and `use "path.nir"` splitting a
  program across files, all real and tested — see `docs/ROADMAP.md` Track
  F, F2. The legacy `module "Display Name" { ... }` nav-label form
  (still just a nav label, no scoping) is untouched and still works.
- [OPEN] A composable UI layout system — Phase A [DONE]: `screen
  <Struct> { layout { row { column { group "..." { field x } } } } }`,
  real containers (row/column/grid/group/tabs), plus a searchable +
  scroll-paginated dropdown, a live timeline widget, and colored status
  badges — see `docs/ROADMAP.md` Track F, F4. A per-element `css: "..."`
  styling override and the rest of the widget catalog are still open.

## How to help

Pick an `[OPEN]` item above, comment on its GitHub issue (or open one
if it doesn't exist yet), and say what you're picking up before
starting on anything non-trivial. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Docs, examples, and `.nir` test cases are just as valuable as compiler
work and are the fastest way to make a first contribution.
