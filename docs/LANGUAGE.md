# Nirdosha — language and feature reference

A practical reference to what Nirdosha actually supports today, mined
directly from the implementation (`crates/compiler/src/`) rather than from the
design docs (`docs/goal.md`, `docs/Nirdosha_Unified_Plan.md`), which describe
intent and aspiration as much as delivered fact. Where something is
interpreter-only vs. compiled to native code, that's called out
explicitly — it matters for anyone benchmarking or reasoning about
performance.

---

## 1. Execution modes

```sh
nirdosha <file.nir> [--format=json]   # interpret (tree-walking)
nirdosha build <file.nir> -o <out> [--opt0]   # compile to a native binary (LLVM, -O2 by default)
nirdosha emit-llvm <file.nir>         # print the generated LLVM IR
nirdosha emit-ast <file.nir>          # print the parsed AST as JSON
```

- **Interpret** — always works for every construct in this document.
- **Build/emit-llvm** — only supports the subset covered in §10
  ("What's compiled"). Everything else is rejected at compile time with
  a specific reason (`codegen::check_supported`), never silently
  mis-compiled.
- `--format=json` — on failure, prints a structured `Diagnostic` (one
  shape across type/ownership/runtime errors) instead of a plain-text
  message. `emit-ast` always prints JSON — the same `Serialize`-derived
  shape a fragment-validation caller (`typeck::validate_fragment`) can
  deserialize back.

## 2. Types

| Type | Spelling | Affine? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signed integers | `i8` `i16` `i32` `i64` | no | Range-checked at every `let`/return/assign boundary (runtime; some proven away statically — see §8). |
| Unsigned integers | `u8` `u16` `u32` `u64` `usize` | no | Same range-checking. Compiled (§10) — same widths as their signed counterparts; `codegen.rs` needs the signed-vs-unsigned instruction choice in exactly one place, not throughout (every unsigned type's range is capped at `[0, i64::MAX]`, and this backend computes all arithmetic at `i64` width regardless of source width). |
| Float | `f64` | no | IEEE 754 double. One width — no `f32`, no literal-widening story. Saturates (`inf`/`NaN`), never traps. |
| Decimal | `dec128` | no | 2026-08-26. 128-bit fixed-point decimal (`rust_decimal::Decimal` backs the interpreter's `Value`), up to 28 significant digits. One width — no `dec32`/`dec64`, and no user-facing scale parameter: scale lives on the *value*, not the type (`dec_scale`, §5), the same way `rust_decimal::Decimal` itself tracks it internally. No literal syntax and no implicit conversion to/from `i64`/`f64` (same "no implicit numeric conversions, ever" rule as §3) — construct via `dec_from_str`/`dec_from_i64` (§5) only. `+`/`-`/`*`/`/`/comparisons are native, like any other numeric scalar (§4); a result past 28 digits traps (Tier-1/2 `abort()`, §8), the same idiom as int div-by-zero, not a `Result`. **Interpreter-only for now** — `nirdosha build`/`emit-llvm` reject it with a specific reason (§10), joining `db`/`json`/`mq` rather than silently mis-compiling. See §6c for the `Money` convention built on it. |
| Boolean | `bool` | no | |
| Unit | `unit` | no | No literal syntax — only reachable as a function's implicit return. |
| String | `str` | no | UTF-8, `Arc<str>`-backed. Literal + escapes (`\"` `\\` `\n` `\t` `\r`) only — no concatenation, slicing, or indexing. May not be, or be part of, a user `fn`'s parameter or return type — see §6b. |
| Heap cell | `box T` | **yes** | Single-owner heap allocation. `*expr` dereferences. RFC 0006 Pillar 1's `Iso<T>` — already satisfied by this type's own affinity, no separate `iso` keyword. |
| Frozen cell | `froze T` | no | 2026-09. RFC 0006 Pillar 1's `Froze<T>` — heap-allocated exactly like `box T`, but freely copyable and shareable across any number of concurrent computations at once (safe because nothing can write through one). `*expr` reads; rejected at compile time if `T` is itself affine, the same rule `&T`'s own deref uses (extracting affine content by value out from under a possibly-multiply-held handle would duplicate ownership). Compiled (§10). Leaked, not refcounted — a real, disclosed narrower scope than `Arc`. |
| Shared reference | `&T` | no | Read-only borrow of a plain identifier only (`&x`, not `&(x+1)`). No `&mut`. |
| Thread handle | `thread T` | **yes** | A spawned computation's real-OS-thread handle; `join` consumes it once. Compiled (§10) — word-sized `T` only (see §10's own note); a real OS thread pool underneath (`runtime-kernels`), not simulated. |
| Channel | `chan T` | no | Unbounded MPMC queue; the handle is freely copyable, the *payload* moves through `send`. Compiled (§10) — word-sized `T` only; a real cross-thread queue underneath, not simulated. A global runtime deadlock detector catches every concurrently-running thread being simultaneously blocked in `recv`/`join` and aborts with a diagnostic, rather than hanging forever (§7). |
| Sandbox handle | `sandbox` | **yes** | A real, separate OS process; `stop` consumes it once. |
| TCP connection | `tcp` | **yes** | A real TCP socket (client or accepted server side); `stop` closes it once. |
| TCP listener | `tcp_listener` | **yes** | A real bound+listening TCP socket; `accept` doesn't consume it, `stop` does. |
| File handle | `file` | **yes** | A real local file (`open(path, mode)`); `send`/`recv`/`stop` reused verbatim from `tcp` — see `docs/PROTOLANG_PORT.md`. |
| Verified identity | `VerifiedIdentity` | no | Row 12: result of validating an external IdP token. Freely copyable. Fields: `subject`, `issuer`, `audience`, `expires_at`, `issued_at`, `claims_json`. |
| Role proof | `RoleView` | no | Row 12: proof that `check_role(identity, role)` succeeded. Field: `role`. |
| Claim proof | `ClaimView` | no | Row 12: proof that `extract_claim(identity, name)` succeeded. Field: `value`. |
| Vector | `Vector(T, N)` | no | Fixed-length dense 1-D array, `N` a compile-time literal. `Vector(f64, 3) ≠ Vector(f64, 4)` — different types. |
| Matrix | `Matrix(T, R, C)` | no | Fixed-shape dense 2-D array, row-major, `R`/`C` compile-time literals. |

`Vector`/`Matrix` are generic over element type `T`, but every dense
linear-algebra builtin (§5) requires `T = f64` specifically — integer- or
bool-element vectors/matrices only support literal construction,
indexing, and elementwise `+`/`-`/`.*`/`./`/`==`/`!=`.

---

## 3. Literals

```
42                  // i64 by default; flexes to a narrower declared width if it fits
3.14                // f64 — decimal only, no scientific notation
true  false
"hello\nworld"      // \" \\ \n \t \r only
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]                       // Vector(f64, 3)
[[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]              // Matrix(f64, 2, 2), row-major
```

Integer literals are the *only* thing with width flexibility — `let n:
i8 = 100` needs no cast, but `let a: i64 = 1; let b: i32 = 2; a + b` is a
type error (no implicit conversions, ever, between two already-typed
values). A float literal is always exactly `f64`; there is no
int↔float conversion operator at all. `dec128` has no literal syntax at
all (not even a decimal-point form) — it's built only from
`dec_from_str`/`dec_from_i64` (§5), so `dec128 + i64` is the same type
error as `i64 + i32` above.

---

## 4. Operators

| Op | Meaning | Operand shapes |
|---|---|---|
| `+` `-` | Add/subtract | scalar↔scalar (same type); `Vector`/`Matrix` elementwise (exact same shape) |
| `*` | Multiply | scalar↔scalar; scalar×`Matrix` (either order, scalar type = element type); `Matrix`×`Vector` (inner dims match); `Matrix`×`Matrix` (inner dims match) |
| `/` | Divide | scalar↔scalar only. Int: traps on zero (Tier-2 runtime check, provable away — §8). Float: saturates to `inf`/`NaN`, never traps. |
| `.*` `./` | Hadamard (elementwise) multiply/divide | scalar or `Vector`/`Matrix`, exact same shape |
| `==` `!=` | Equality | any matching type, including `Vector`/`Matrix` (structural) |
| `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | Ordering | numeric scalars only |
| `&&` `\|\|` | Short-circuit bool | `bool` only |
| `!` | Not | `bool` |
| `-` (unary) | Negate | numeric scalar |
| `*` (unary) | Deref | `box T` or `&T` |
| `&` (unary) | Borrow | a plain identifier |

`Vector * Vector` is a **type error** by design (ambiguous — inner vs.
outer product) — use `dot()`.

No `%` (modulo), no bitwise operators, no `f.(x)`-style broadcasting.

---

## 5. Builtins

Every builtin is native Rust, registered by name (`ast::BUILTIN_NAMES`) —
not expressible in Nirdosha source itself (no generics, no `for` loops
to write them with). All require `f64` elements unless noted.

**I/O**
- `print(x)` — any number of args, any type, when interpreted. When
  *compiled*, every scalar shape works (integer/`f64`/`str`/`bool`/
  `unit` — literal, variable, or computed result, all identically); the
  one remaining gap is a whole `Vector`/`Matrix` argument (§10).

**Dense linear algebra** (Phase 2)
- `transpose(m: Matrix) -> Matrix` — any element type.
- `dot(a: Vector, b: Vector) -> T` — same length, numeric element.
- `cross(a: Vector(T,3), b: Vector(T,3)) -> Vector(T,3)` — 3-vectors only.
- `zeros(n)` / `zeros(r, c)` → `Vector(f64,n)` / `Matrix(f64,r,c)` — `n`/`r`/`c` **must be literal integers** (the result's shape has to be known at typecheck time).
- `ones(n)` / `ones(r, c)` — same shape rule, filled with `1.0`.
- `identity(n)` → `Matrix(f64, n, n)`.
- `sum(v_or_m) -> T` — any numeric element type.
- `len(v: Vector) -> i64`.
- `norm(v: Vector(f64,_)) -> f64` — 2-norm. `norm1` — sum of `|x|`. `norm_inf` — max `|x|`. `frobenius_norm(m: Matrix(f64,_,_))`.
- `trace(m: Matrix(T,n,n)) -> T` — square only (`NotSquare` otherwise), numeric element.
- `det(m: Matrix(f64,n,n)) -> f64` — Gaussian elimination, partial pivoting.
- `inv(m: Matrix(f64,n,n)) -> Matrix(f64,n,n)` — Gauss-Jordan; runtime error (`SingularMatrix`) if singular.
- `solve(a: Matrix(f64,n,n), b: Vector(f64,n)) -> Vector(f64,n)` — `A \ b`; `SingularMatrix` if singular.
- `rank(m: Matrix(f64,_,_)) -> i64` — row-echelon reduction, any shape.
- `is_symmetric(m)` / `is_diag(m)` — square `Matrix(f64,n,n)` only. `is_square(m)` — any `Matrix`, any element type.

**Deterministic simulation** (Phase 3)
- `rand_seed(seed: <int>)` — resets the RNG stream (SplitMix64; see §9 — interpreted and compiled each keep their own, per §9/§10). Required before any draw.
- `rand_f64() -> f64` — uniform `[0, 1)`.
- `rand_gaussian(mean: f64, stddev: f64) -> f64` — Box-Muller.
- `distance(a: Vector(f64,3), b: Vector(f64,3)) -> f64` — Euclidean.
- `bearing(from: Vector(f64,3), to: Vector(f64,3)) -> f64` — initial great-circle bearing, degrees `[0,360)`; takes lat/lon/alt vectors, altitude ignored.
- `lla_to_ecef(v: Vector(f64,3)) -> Vector(f64,3)` / `ecef_to_lla` — WGS84.
- `ecef_to_enu(ecef, ref_lla) -> Vector(f64,3)` / `enu_to_ecef` — local East-North-Up relative to a reference point.
- `kf_predict_state(x, P, F, Q) -> Vector` / `kf_predict_cov(x, P, F, Q) -> Matrix` — linear Kalman filter predict step (split in two — no tuple/struct return type exists).
- `kf_update_state(x, P, z, H, R) -> Vector` / `kf_update_cov(...) -> Matrix` — update step.

**Database** (`Ty::Db`, interpreter-only — `docs/PROTOLANG_PORT.md`'s "Locked design 5: DB")
- `db_connect(conn_str: str) -> Result(db, str)` — a bare path or `:memory:` opens a local SQLite database (`rusqlite`, bundled); a `postgres://`/`postgresql://` connection string instead connects to a real Postgres server (`postgres`/`postgres-native-tls` — `crates/compiler/src/dbconn.rs`). Same four-function surface either way; only `db_connect`'s own argument decides the backend, chosen once and fixed for that handle's lifetime.
- `db_query(conn: db, sql: str, ...up to 8 bind values) -> Result(json, str)` — row-returning statements (`SELECT`). Bind values are `i64`/`f64`/`str`/`bool` (or a zero-payload `enum` variant, bound as its name), the only way to parameterize a query since `str` has no concatenation (§2). `?` placeholders (SQLite's own positional style) are rewritten to Postgres's `$1, $2, ...` automatically when the handle is a Postgres connection, so the same `sql` string and call site work against either backend. Every row comes back as one JSON object (column name → value); the whole result set is a JSON array, navigated with `json_array_len`/`json_array_get`/`json_get_*` like any other JSON document.
- `db_execute(conn: db, sql: str, ...up to 8 bind values) -> Result(i64, str)` — everything else (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/DDL); returns the affected-row count.
- `stop(conn)` — closes the connection (reuses `tcp`/`file`'s keyword).
- A connection failure, SQL syntax error, or constraint violation is `Err(message)`, never a trap — the database engine's own error message passed straight through.
- Postgres is strongly typed at the wire level (unlike SQLite): a schema column meant to hold a Nirdosha `i64`/`f64`/`bool`/`str` value should be declared `BIGINT`/`DOUBLE PRECISION`/`BOOLEAN`/`TEXT` — a narrower column type (e.g. `integer`) is a clear `Err` from the driver, not a silent misbind.
- TLS to Postgres is opt-in, read from the connection string's own `sslmode=require`/`verify-ca`/`verify-full`; no `sslmode` (or `disable`/`prefer`/`allow`) connects in plaintext.
- `nirdosha serve --db <path>`'s auto-generated table routes and automatic schema migrations (§13) are a separate mechanism, still SQLite-only.

**Decimal arithmetic** (`dec128`, interpreter-only — §2, §10) — 2026-08-26.
- `dec_from_str(s: str) -> Result(dec128, str)` — parses a decimal string (optional leading `-`, digits, optional `.` + digits; no scientific notation, no thousands separators). `Err(message)` on malformed input — external data, not a trap, the same convention as `db_query`/`db_execute` above.
- `dec_from_i64(v: i64, scale: u32) -> dec128` — `v` is the unscaled integer, `scale` the number of implied decimal places (`dec_from_i64(1999, 2)` is `19.99`). Traps if `scale > 28` (Tier-1/2 guard, §8) — the representation's own limit, not a data problem, so this one doesn't return `Result`.
- `dec_to_str(d: dec128) -> str` — canonical string form, no scientific notation, trailing zeros kept out to the value's own scale (`19.90` round-trips as `"19.90"`, not `"19.9"`).
- `dec_round(d: dec128, scale: u32) -> dec128` — round-half-to-even ("banker's rounding") to `scale` places. The only rounding policy v1 ships; named explicitly here rather than picked silently, since interest/tax/FX math is exactly where a rounding-mode choice needs to be visible.
- `dec_scale(d: dec128) -> u32` — the value's current number of decimal places, since scale lives on the value, not the type (§2).
- Arithmetic (`+ - * /`) and comparisons (`== != < > <= >=`) work on `dec128` natively — the same operator dispatch every numeric scalar gets (§4), no builtin functions needed. `/` rounds to the type's max representable scale rather than trapping on a non-terminating result (e.g. `1 / 3`); narrow with `dec_round` afterward when a program needs fewer places.
- `db_query`/`db_execute` bind values gain `dec128` as a sixth bindable type, sent as `dec_to_str`'s canonical form. Use a `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` Postgres column, not `DOUBLE PRECISION` — reintroducing float storage on the far side defeats the point. SQLite has no real decimal column type; `TEXT` is the honest choice there.
- JSON encode/decode (`nirdosha serve`, `json_get_*`) represents `dec128` as a JSON **string**, not a JSON number, for the same reason as the DB binding — a JSON number is IEEE-754 double under nearly every consumer's parser, exactly the silent-drift failure this type exists to prevent. `emit-ui` renders a `dec128` field as a text input, not `<input type=number>`.

**Identity / relying party** (Row 12)
- `oidc_validate_token(token: str, expected_issuer: str, expected_audience: str, jwks_json: str) -> Result(VerifiedIdentity, str)` — validates a mock OIDC/JWT ID token against the supplied JWKS JSON (HMAC-SHA256). Checks issuer, audience, and signature. Returns a `VerifiedIdentity` on success. The runtime never mints tokens; it only consumes externally-issued ones.
- `check_role(identity: VerifiedIdentity, role: str) -> Result(RoleView, str)` — succeeds if `identity.claims_json` contains a `roles` array with the requested role.
- `extract_claim(identity: VerifiedIdentity, name: str) -> Result(ClaimView, str)` — extracts a string claim from `identity.claims_json`.
- `check_role_path(identity: VerifiedIdentity, path: str, role: str) -> Result(RoleView, str)` — `check_role`'s dotted-path sibling, for IdPs that nest the roles array under a path instead of a flat top-level `"roles"` field (e.g. Keycloak's `"realm_access.roles"`). `check_role`/`extract_claim` are unchanged and still the right call for a flat claim — including one whose own name contains a literal dot (Auth0-style namespaced claims like `"https://myapp.example.com/roles"`), which is a flat key, not a nested path.
- `extract_claim_path(identity: VerifiedIdentity, path: str) -> Result(ClaimView, str)` — `extract_claim`'s dotted-path sibling, same nested-vs-flat distinction as `check_role_path` above.
- `identity_expired(identity: VerifiedIdentity, now: i64) -> bool` — true if `now > identity.expires_at`.

## 6. Control flow, functions, ownership

```
fn name(param: Ty, ...) -> RetTy effect(...)? requires(...)? { ... }   // RetTy omitted => unit
let x: Ty = expr
x = expr                                    // reassignment, not a new binding
return expr?
while cond { ... }
if cond { ... } else { ... }                // also usable as an expression: let x = if c {1} else {2}
audited "non-empty justification" { ... }   // suppresses codegen's Tier-1/2 guards inside; interpreter unaffected
```

- **No `for` loops**, no closures/lambdas. **First-class functions do
  exist** (interpreter-only — see §10 and "Privileged first-class
  functions" below): a plain function name, used where a `fn(T1, T2) ->
  R`-typed value is expected, evaluates to that function as a value —
  `let f: fn(i64) -> i64 = double`, `f(21)`, or passing one as an
  ordinary higher-order argument. Still no closures — a first-class
  function value is just a target name, nothing captured (this language
  has no enclosing-scope capture at all).
- **Recursion works** — functions are looked up by name in a table, so
  direct and mutual recursion both work (see `fib` in `crates/bench/corpus.json`).
- **Ownership**: `box`/`thread`/`sandbox`/`tcp`/`tcp_listener`/`file` are
  *affine* — using the binding by name moves it; a later use on the same
  path is a static "use after move" error, checked by a real move-checker
  (`ownership.rs`), not just at runtime. `&` borrows without moving.
- **Effects** (`docs/PROTOLANG_PORT.md`'s "Locked design 1", `effects.rs`): a
  `fn` may optionally declare `effect(pure)` or `effect(t1, t2, ...)` where
  each `t` is one of `rng`/`io`/`concurrent`/`network` — a Koka-style
  *set*, not a total order. Omitted entirely (the common case): fully
  inferred, nothing checked, zero notational cost. Declared: the real
  effect set (computed by fixpoint iteration over the call graph, so
  mutual recursion works) must be a *subset* of what's declared —
  declaring more than the body uses is fine, an undeclared-but-performed
  effect is `TypeErrorKind::EffectNotDeclared`. `pure` denotes the empty
  set and can't be combined with other names. Typeck-only; no codegen
  changes — the whole compiled subset (§10) is `pure` except `print`
  (`io`).
- **No tuples** — `struct`/`enum`/`match` and generics exist (Row 11,
  `docs/nirdosha_row11_amendment.md`), so returning a record or sum type is
  possible. The Kalman-filter builtins above remain split for historical
  reasons, not because the language lacks product types.

### 6a. Privileged first-class functions

```
fn transfer_funds(amount: i64) -> i64 requires(role: "admin") { ... }
fn read_chart(id: Text) -> Text requires(claim: "department", "cardiology") { ... }

acquire transfer_funds(proof)   // proof: RoleView/ClaimView -> Result(fn(...)->..., str)
```

A `requires(role: "<name>")` or `requires(claim: "<name>", "<value>")`
annotation gates a function's *value*, not just its behavior: `fn`'s name
has no direct-call path at all once gated — `transfer_funds(500)` and
`let f = transfer_funds` are both **static** `TypeErrorKind::
PrivilegedFnNotAcquired` errors, not runtime ones. `acquire fn_name(proof)`
is the only way to obtain a callable value, and it demands a real proof:
a `RoleView` (from `check_role`) for a `role` requirement, a `ClaimView`
(from `extract_claim`) for a `claim` one — both already real values
produced by the identity feature (§5's "Identity / relying party"),
itself validating a token issued by an external IdP. Nirdosha never
mints its own proof of privilege; "user management" stays entirely
external, the same as `oidc_validate_token`'s own scope. `acquire`
checks the proof's field against the requirement string at runtime
(same spirit as `check_role`'s own string check) and returns
`Result(fn(params) -> ret, str)`.

**`requires(public)` — 2026-08-26, `docs/ROADMAP.md` A10.** `nirdosha serve`
routes every declared `fn` (`serve.rs::dispatch`'s route resolution has
no allowlist), and authorization only runs `if let Some(req) = &f.requires`
— so a function with **neither** `requires(...)` **nor** a
`VerifiedIdentity` parameter is reachable at `POST /api/<fn>` by anyone,
with no token at all. That was previously silent: nothing in this file,
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, or a typecheck pass said so. `requires(public)` is the fix:
an explicit marker meaning "this fn is intentionally callable with no
token." Unlike `requires(role: ...)`/`requires(claim: ..., ...)`, it does
**not** gate the function — `FnDecl::requires` stays `None`, so a
`requires(public)`-marked fn needs no `acquire` and is exactly as
directly callable as one with no `requires(...)` at all:

```
fn health_check() -> bool requires(public) { return true }
```

Its only effect is silencing `typeck::ungated_fn_warnings`'s new
diagnostic — a **non-fatal** warning (never blocks `nirdosha build`/
`run`/`serve`, unlike a real `TypeErrorKind`), printed by `nirdosha serve`/
`emit-ui` for every `fn` with no `requires(...)`, no `requires(public)`, no
`VerifiedIdentity` parameter, and no `db`/`mq` parameter (the last two
already 400 at `serve.rs::decode_value` regardless, so they're excluded
from the count the same way `docs/API_TRUST_MODEL.md` §4 excludes them). It's
a warning, not a gate: a program that never adds `requires(public)`
anywhere still serves exactly as it did before this fix — the point is
that an author now *sees* every unintentionally-open endpoint at
`serve`/`emit-ui` time instead of discovering it in a security review.
Full writeup: `docs/API_TRUST_MODEL.md` §4.

This is deliberately different from an annotation-based checker like
Spring's `@PreAuthorize`: there's no ambient thread-local security
context to consult (or forget to consult) at each call site, and no AOP
proxy to accidentally bypass by calling the underlying implementation
directly — there *is* no underlying direct-call path to bypass to. The
acquired value is an ordinary first-class function once obtained: pass
it to code that has no idea it was privileged, store it in a struct,
return it, call it many times — the check happens exactly once, at
acquisition, not smeared across (or missing from) every call site.
Interpreter-only for now, like every construct past §10's compiled
subset — `nirdosha build` rejects `fn(..)->..`/`acquire` with a specific
reason, never silently mis-compiles one.

### 6b. `str` at function boundaries ("enum favoring")

A user-defined `fn`'s parameter or return type may not be, or contain,
`str` — checked recursively through `Result`/`Option`/generics, `box`/
`&`/`thread`/`chan`, `Vector`/`Matrix`, and `fn(...) -> ...` types
(`TypeErrorKind::StrInFnSignature`, `typeck.rs::check_fn`). The point is
to push stringly-typed control flow (`if status == "PENDING"`,
`match currency { "USD" => ..., "EUR" => ... }`) toward real `enum`s —
which already get exhaustive `match` and already render as searchable
dropdowns in `emit-ui` (§11) with zero extra work — instead of `==`/
literal-`match` over `str`.

`str` itself is completely unrestricted everywhere else: an ordinary
`struct` field type, a local `let` binding's type, a literal. Two
conventions carry what a bare `str` parameter/return used to:

- **A closed, categorical vocabulary** (a status, a currency code, a
  decision) becomes a small zero-payload `enum`.
- **Genuine free text** that still needs to cross a function boundary
  (a justification, a note, a reference, an identity subject) gets
  wrapped in a one-field carrier struct, conventionally named `Text`:
  ```
  struct Text {
      value: str,
  }
  ```
  Struct construction is an ordinary call to a name registered as a
  constructor (§3.1), never a `fn_decl` — so `Text("free text")` at a
  call site, and a function taking/returning `Text` instead of bare
  `str`, are both unaffected by the ban. A function that needs the raw
  string (to hand to a builtin like `db_execute`) reads `.value`.
  `Text` round-trips through JSON automatically wherever `nirdosha
  serve` decodes/encodes request/response bodies (`serve.rs`'s
  `decode_value`/`encode_value` are already generic over structs), and
  `emit-ui` renders it as a plain text input, not a nested group
  (`ui_gen.rs::build_field`'s one-field-`Text`-struct special case).

  Comparing two `struct`/`enum` values with `==`/`!=` — the natural next
  reach once a status/currency-style field is a real enum instead of a
  string — typechecked already (`unify_operands` permits `==`/`!=`
  generically for any matching type) but had no arm in the interpreter's
  binary-operator dispatch to actually evaluate it, so it trapped at
  runtime with a confusing `TypeMismatch` despite typechecking cleanly —
  the same kind of typeck/interpreter gap `str`'s own `==` once had
  (found the same way — by testing code that typechecks, not by
  re-reading either file; see `interpreter.rs`'s `Value::Str` binop
  arm). Fixed alongside this migration
  (`interpreter.rs::eval_binary`'s `Value::Struct`/`Value::Enum` arm,
  delegating to `Value`'s own already-correct `PartialEq`), since
  pushing code toward enums is pointless if comparing them then traps.

The ban applies only to entries in a program's own `fns` list. Three
things are exempt **by construction**, not by special-casing:
- **Builtins** (`http_get`/`db_query`/`json_get_str`/`oidc_validate_token`/
  `mock_issue_token`/`print`/... — §5) are resolved by name in
  `Expr::Call`, never appearing as `fn_decl`s — the language's actual
  external-I/O boundary (an HTTP body, SQL text, a JWT, a JSON document)
  is irreducibly `str` and stays that way.
- **Struct/enum constructors** are calls to a registered type name, also
  never `fn_decl`s — a struct can freely keep a `str` field.
- **`transact`'s synthesized `txn_id` parameter** (docs/TRANSACT.md) is the
  one narrow, name-based exemption: `network`'s call must pass `txn_id`
  as a real `str` argument, and it must stay a plain scalar for WAL
  durability (`Ty::is_transact_scalar`) — it can't be wrapped in `Text`.
  A parameter literally named `txn_id` is skipped by `check_fn`'s scan.

An enum variant may itself carry a `str` payload (`enum ErrorCode {
NotFound, External(str) }`) without tripping this rule — the check only
inspects a `fn`'s own declared parameter/return *type expression*
(`Ty::contains_str`), which for a bare `Ty::Named("ErrorCode", [])` has
no argument to recurse into; the `str` lives inside the enum's own
declaration, not the signature. This is the same "a payload type is not
a signature type" reasoning that already exempts struct fields, applied
to enums — a legitimate, precedented pattern for a shared error type
that needs to both enumerate known application-level cases (`NotFound`)
and forward an unpredictable builtin failure message (`External(str)`)
uniformly through one `Result(_, ErrorCode)`, not a loophole around the
rule's intent (nothing compares an `External` payload with `==`/
literal-`match`).

### 6c. `Money` and `CurrencyCode` — real prelude types

2026-08-26, promoted to a real prelude type 2026-08-27. `Money` and
`CurrencyCode` are built into every `.nir` program automatically, the
same way `Option`/`Result`/`HttpResponse` already are
(`ast.rs::prelude_structs`/`prelude_enums`) — no declaration needed, and
nothing to paste in. (They started life one day earlier as a *documented
convention* — two declarations an author pasted into their own program,
same shape `Text` still is below — until pasting the same ~180-variant
enum into every program that needed one made the convention itself the
next thing worth fixing.)

```
struct Money {
    amount: dec128,
    currency: CurrencyCode,
}

enum CurrencyCode {
    AED, AFN, ALL, AMD, ANG, AOA, ARS, AUD, AWG, AZN,
    BAM, BBD, BDT, BGN, BHD, BIF, BMD, BND, BOB, BRL, BSD, BTN, BWP, BYN, BZD,
    CAD, CDF, CHF, CLP, CNY, COP, CRC, CUP, CVE, CZK,
    DJF, DKK, DOP, DZD,
    EGP, ERN, ETB, EUR,
    FJD, FKP,
    GBP, GEL, GHS, GIP, GMD, GNF, GTQ, GYD,
    HKD, HNL, HTG, HUF,
    IDR, ILS, INR, IQD, IRR, ISK,
    JMD, JOD, JPY,
    KES, KGS, KHR, KMF, KPW, KRW, KWD, KYD, KZT,
    LAK, LBP, LKR, LRD, LSL, LYD,
    MAD, MDL, MGA, MKD, MMK, MNT, MOP, MRU, MUR, MVR, MWK, MXN, MYR, MZN,
    NAD, NGN, NIO, NOK, NPR, NZD,
    OMR,
    PAB, PEN, PGK, PHP, PKR, PLN, PYG,
    QAR,
    RON, RSD, RUB, RWF,
    SAR, SBD, SCR, SDG, SEK, SGD, SHP, SLE, SOS, SRD, SSP, STN, SVC, SYP, SZL,
    THB, TJS, TMT, TND, TOP, TRY, TTD, TWD, TZS,
    UAH, UGX, USD, UYU, UZS,
    VES, VND, VUV,
    WST,
    XAF, XCD, XOF, XPF,
    YER,
    ZAR, ZMW, ZWG,
}
```

This closes the two holes the *naming-convention* version left open:
`Money.amount` can't silently be an `f64` (§2's type-checked construction
via `dec_from_str`/`dec_from_i64`), and `Money.currency` gets exhaustive
`match`, `==`/`!=`, and a searchable `emit-ui` dropdown for free, the same
as any other enum field (§6b) — instead of `match currency { "USD" =>
...`.

**What this deliberately doesn't give you: compile-time currency-mixing
safety.** `Money(USD)` and `Money(EUR)` are not distinct *types* — currency
lives in a field, not a type parameter. Nirdosha's generics (Row 11,
`docs/nirdosha_row11_amendment.md`) could in principle make them distinct
(`struct Money(C) { amount: dec128 }`, instantiated once per currency) —
the same phantom-type trick Rust's `typed-money` crate uses. It's
deliberately not done that way here: a `Money(C)` per-currency type can't
sit in one `db_query` result row, one JSON array, or one `emit-ui` table
column where the currency *varies row to row* — which is the ordinary
shape of a ledger/payments table, not the exception. A generic `Money(C)`
only earns its keep when a whole computation is pinned to one currency at
compile time (an FX function's declared input side, say); it's a local
tool, not the default representation.

Combining two `Money` values with mismatched currencies is therefore
caught at the point they're combined, not by the compiler:

```
enum ErrorCode { CurrencyMismatch }

fn add_money(a: Money, b: Money) -> Result(Money, ErrorCode) {
    if a.currency != b.currency {
        return Err(CurrencyMismatch())
    }
    return Ok(Money(a.amount + b.amount, a.currency))
}
```

**On the `CurrencyCode` list above:** a best-effort transcription of
ISO 4217's *active, transactable* codes, dated 2026-08-26 — it excludes
precious-metal/fund settlement codes (`XAU`/`XAG`/`XPD`/`XPT`/`XDR`/`BOV`/
`CHE`/`CHW`/`CLF`/`COU`/`MXV`/`USN`/`UYW`/`UYI`) and the no-currency/test
codes (`XXX`/`XTS`). Verify against the current published ISO 4217 table
before relying on it in production — currency codes are revised
periodically (e.g. `ZWL`→`ZWG` in 2024, `SLL`→`SLE` in 2022), and this
snapshot was written from memory, not re-derived from the standard.

### 6d. `Measure` and `UnitCode` — real prelude types

2026-08-26, promoted to a real prelude type 2026-08-27, same shape and
same reasoning as `Money`/`CurrencyCode` (§6c): a `dec128` value paired
with a closed enum, built into every `.nir` program automatically —
no declaration needed.

```
struct Measure {
    value: dec128,
    unit: UnitCode,
}

enum UnitCode {
    // Length
    Metre, Centimetre, Millimetre, Kilometre,
    Inch, Foot, Yard, Mile, NauticalMile,
    // Mass
    Milligram, Gram, Kilogram, MetricTon, PoundAv, OunceAv,
    // Volume
    Millilitre, Litre, CubicMetre, CubicFoot, USGallon, UKGallon, USBarrel,
    // Area
    SquareMetre, SquareFoot, Hectare,
    // Time
    Second, Minute, Hour, Day,
    // Temperature
    Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin,
    // Count -- UCUM's curly-brace "annotation" convention, not true units
    Each, Dozen,
}
```

**Why an enum field, not `Length(Metre)` vs `Length(Inch)` as distinct
generic types:** the `Money`/`Money(C)` tradeoff in §6c applies here
unchanged — a per-unit generic type can't sit in one `db_query` row or
one `emit-ui` column where the unit *varies row to row* (a shipment
weight that's `kg` for one supplier and `lb` for another is the ordinary
case, not the exception). But physical units have a second problem
currencies don't: **ISO 4217 is a closed, flat list — UCUM isn't.** UCUM
unit *codes* are compositional expressions (`kg.m/s2`, `mm[Hg]`,
`10*3/uL`), not a fixed vocabulary, so there is no version of this enum
that's "the full standard" the way `CurrencyCode` (§6c) actually is
ISO 4217. `UnitCode` above is a curated subset — the units a real
program needs — extended the same way `CurrencyCode` is: add a variant
when a program needs one that isn't here. It does not, and cannot without
a real unit-expression parser (a separate, much bigger feature), accept
arbitrary UCUM expressions.

**Bridging to the real UCUM code**, for interop with a system that
expects the standard's own strings (an EDI/customs document, say) — a
lookup, not a claim that the variant name *is* the code, since most UCUM
codes (`[in_i]`, `{each}`) aren't valid Nirdosha identifiers:

```
fn ucum_code(u: UnitCode) -> Text {
    return match u {
        Metre => Text("m"),
        Centimetre => Text("cm"),
        Millimetre => Text("mm"),
        Kilometre => Text("km"),
        Inch => Text("[in_i]"),
        Foot => Text("[ft_i]"),
        Yard => Text("[yd_i]"),
        Mile => Text("[mi_i]"),
        NauticalMile => Text("[nmi_i]"),
        Milligram => Text("mg"),
        Gram => Text("g"),
        Kilogram => Text("kg"),
        MetricTon => Text("t"),
        PoundAv => Text("[lb_av]"),
        OunceAv => Text("[oz_av]"),
        Millilitre => Text("mL"),
        Litre => Text("L"),
        CubicMetre => Text("m3"),
        CubicFoot => Text("[cft_i]"),
        USGallon => Text("[gal_us]"),
        UKGallon => Text("[gal_br]"),
        USBarrel => Text("[bbl_us]"),
        SquareMetre => Text("m2"),
        SquareFoot => Text("[sft_i]"),
        Hectare => Text("har"),
        Second => Text("s"),
        Minute => Text("min"),
        Hour => Text("h"),
        Day => Text("d"),
        Celsius => Text("Cel"),
        Fahrenheit => Text("[degF]"),
        Kelvin => Text("K"),
        Each => Text("{each}"),
        Dozen => Text("{dozen}"),
    }
}
```

Combining two `Measure` values needs a matching-unit check, the same
discipline `add_money` (§6c) applies to currency — extending that same
`ErrorCode` enum with one more variant, since a real program pasting in
both conventions shares one `ErrorCode`:

```
enum ErrorCode { CurrencyMismatch, UnitMismatch }

fn add_measure(a: Measure, b: Measure) -> Result(Measure, ErrorCode) {
    if a.unit != b.unit {
        return Err(UnitMismatch())
    }
    return Ok(Measure(a.value + b.value, a.unit))
}
```

**What this doesn't give you: unit conversion.** `add_measure` above
*refuses* mismatched units, it doesn't convert between them — going from
"refuse" to "convert `[ft_i]` to `m` automatically" needs a
conversion-factor table keyed by unit pair (and, for temperature,
non-linear conversion — `Cel`→`[degF]` isn't a scale factor). That's a
real, separate feature, not shipped here.

## 7. Concurrency & I/O

```
spawn f(args)              // returns thread T, backed by a real, reused OS worker thread
join(t)                    // blocks, consumes the handle, returns T
let c: chan T = chan
send(c, v)                 // never blocks (unbounded queue)
recv(c) -> T                // blocks until a value is available

sandbox f(args)             // real, separate OS process (re-execs the nirdosha binary)
stop(s) -> i64               // kills if still running, returns exit code

connect(host: str, port: i64) -> tcp
listen(port: i64) -> tcp_listener
accept(l: tcp_listener) -> tcp   // blocks for the next client
stop(conn)                       // closes a tcp or tcp_listener

open(path: str, mode: str) -> file   // mode is "r", "w", or "a"
send(f, s: str)                       // write (reuses tcp's keyword)
recv(f) -> str                        // read all currently-available bytes; "" at EOF, not an error
stop(f)                               // closes the file (reuses tcp's keyword)
```

`chan`/`sandbox` compose: a `chan T` (T a plain scalar) can cross into a
sandboxed process as a real cross-process transport (a Unix domain
socket under the hood — interpreter-only, since `sandbox` itself is;
see §10). Race-freedom for concurrent code comes entirely from the
ownership checker — an affine value moved into `spawn`/`send` can never
be touched by the sender again.

**`spawn`/`join`/`chan`/`send`/`recv` compile now (§10), backed by a
real admission-controlled kernel, not just interpreted.** `spawn` runs
on a self-tuning, reused-worker OS thread pool
(`runtime-kernels/src/kernel/thread_pool.rs`'s `Scope`) — a program that
spawns many short-lived tasks reuses a small, roughly-peak-concurrency-
sized set of real threads rather than paying a fresh thread-creation
cost every time, and a genuine OS-level failure to create a thread
(real resource exhaustion) is a clean `-1`/trap, not an uncatchable
process abort from the OS itself. Every outstanding `thread` handle
(between `spawn` and its matching `join`) also counts against a real
admission ceiling (`Domain::Thread`, `NIRDOSHA_KERNEL_MAX_THREAD`,
default 10,000) — the same per-domain ceiling `tcp`/`file` already
enforce, hit once a spawned-but-unjoined thread count gets that high.
Word-sized `T` only for now (integers, `bool`, `f64`, `box`/`froze`/
another handle) — `str`/`dec128`/struct/enum payloads are still
interpreter-only, a real, disclosed narrower scope, not a silent gap.

**A dynamic deadlock detector catches the one hazard `spawn`/`chan`
alone don't rule out.** No mutex exists in the language, so lock-order
deadlocks are unrepresentable — but two (or more) threads each blocked
in `recv`/`join`, mutually waiting on something only another blocked
thread could ever produce, is still constructible. The compiled runtime
tracks how many concurrent participants exist against how many are
simultaneously blocked in `join`/`recv` specifically (never `tcp`/`file`
I/O, which can still resolve from outside the process); if every one of
them is blocked at once, nothing left in the process could ever unblock
any of them, and the program aborts immediately with a diagnostic
naming the actual stuck handles, instead of hanging forever. This is
detection, not the compile-time proof RFC 0006's own Pillar 5 would be
— it only catches a *global* stall (the whole program stuck), not a
local cycle between two threads while a third keeps making unrelated
progress.

**This is deliberately not Java-style virtual threads** — Rust has no
safe primitive for stackful continuation-switching the way the JVM
does; a `spawn`'d task that calls a genuinely long blocking operation
still ties up one real worker thread for that duration. What changed is
reuse between tasks, not the cost of blocking itself.

---

## 8. Static guarantees

- **Type checking** (`typeck.rs`) — every program is fully typed before
  it runs; a type error is never discovered mid-execution.
- **Ownership/move-checking** (`ownership.rs`) — affine values statically
  proven single-owner, including across branches and loop iterations.
- **Two independent static bounds-provers**, feeding the same two report
  shapes:
  - **Interval analysis** (`refine.rs`) — no SMT solver, straight-line
    range propagation.
  - **Real Z3** (`smt.rs`) — can prove things interval analysis can't
    (e.g. an index narrowed by an `if` condition).
  - Both prove: (1) an arithmetic result fits its declared integer type,
    (2) a divisor is never zero, (3) a `Vector`/`Matrix` index falls
    inside its declared bounds. **All three are now consumed by codegen**
    (as of `Vector`/`Matrix` codegen landing, §10) — an unprovable index
    still gets a real runtime bounds guard (same `abort()`-trap idiom as
    (1)/(2)), a proven one emits no check at all.
- **`audited "justification" { ... }`** — the one escape hatch: suppresses
  codegen's guard emission inside the block. The compiler only enforces
  that a justification exists and is non-empty; judging its content is a
  review-process concern, not a compiler one.

---

## 9. Determinism

`rand_seed`/`rand_f64`/`rand_gaussian` are backed by a from-scratch
SplitMix64 stream stored **per `Interpreter` instance** (not a process
global) — same seed, same OS, same run, byte-for-byte identical draws,
every time. A `spawn`ed function gets its own independent, unseeded RNG
by default (an honest, documented gap — see `Interpreter::rng`'s doc
comment). `nirdosha build`'s compiled version of this (§10) matches
that exactly, for real, as of 2026-09: a `thread_local!` stream, not a
process-wide `static` (`runtime-kernels/src/lib.rs`'s "rand_seed/
rand_f64/rand_gaussian kernel" section).

**A real bug found and fixed, not just a design gap.** This was briefly
a process-wide `static AtomicU64` stream — originally justified by
"`thread`/`spawn` aren't compiled yet, so there's only ever one thread
to own it," true when written, false once they compiled (§7, §10). Two
real problems followed, both closed by the same fix: every
concurrently-running thread shared one stream (the opposite of the
interpreter's own "independent, unseeded per spawn" behavior), and the
stream's own update (`splitmix64_next`: an atomic load, then a separate
atomic store, not one compare-and-swap) wasn't safe against two threads
calling `rand_f64`/`rand_gaussian` at the same instant — both could read
the same state before either wrote back, silently drawing the same
value or corrupting the stream's period. A `thread_local!` `Cell`
(no atomics needed at all — nothing outside the owning thread ever
touches it) closes both: each thread gets its own independent stream,
started unseeded, restoring the interpreter's own semantics exactly
rather than merely making the sharing race-free. Verified by two real
compiled-and-run tests, not just reasoned about:
`a_spawned_threads_rand_seed_does_not_perturb_the_spawning_threads_stream`
(a spawned thread seeding/drawing its own stream leaves the spawning
thread's own sequence byte-for-byte unchanged) and
`a_freshly_spawned_thread_gets_its_own_unseeded_rng_by_default` (calling
`rand_f64` inside a spawned thread that never seeded its own stream
still aborts, even though the spawning thread already seeded its own —
`crates/compiler/tests/codegen.rs`). No other source of nondeterminism
exists in the language (no ambient clock/entropy reads anywhere in the
builtin set).

---

## 10. What's compiled vs. interpreter-only

**Verify against `codegen::check_supported` directly before trusting
this table** — it drifted stale once already (22 Aug 2026: `box`/`&`/
`*`, `str`, and `tcp`/`tcp_listener`/`connect`/`listen`/`accept` sat
mislabeled interpreter-only here for a while after they'd already
gained real codegen, caught only by testing real compiled binaries —
box round-tripping through a function param, `str` branching on `==`,
a live TCP round trip — not by re-reading this section's own prose).

| Construct | Compiled? | Key caveat |
|---|---|---|
| `i8`–`i64`, `u8`–`usize`, `bool`, `unit`, `f64` | Yes | All integer arithmetic runs at `i64` width internally (widen on load, narrow on store); unsigned range capped `[0, i64::MAX]`. See below. |
| Scalar arith/comparison, `if`/`while`, calls incl. recursion, `print` | Yes | `print(bool)` → `1`/`0`, not `"true"`/`"false"` (cosmetic only). `print(unit)` → `"()"`. |
| Tier-1/2 bounds + div-by-zero guards, `audited` | Yes | Elided where §8 proves safety. |
| `box`/`&`/`*` | Yes | Real `nir_alloc` + automatic `nir_free` (`ownership.rs`'s `FreeMap`) — not a leak. |
| `froze`/`*` | Yes | 2026-09. Same `nir_alloc` as `box`, but leaked, not freed — real, disclosed narrower scope than `Arc`; see §2's own `froze T` row. |
| `thread`/`spawn`/`join`, `chan`/`send`/`recv` | Yes | 2026-09. Word-sized `T` only (integers/`bool`/`f64`/`box`/`froze`/another handle) — `str`/`dec128`/struct/enum payloads still interpreter-only. Real admission ceiling (`Domain::Thread`) and a dynamic deadlock detector — see §7. |
| `str` | Yes | Literals, `==`/`!=`, `if`-condition, `print`, fn params/returns — `main() -> str` compiles directly. |
| `tcp`/`tcp_listener` | Yes | `connect`/`listen`/`accept`/`send`/`recv`/`stop` over real sockets. |
| `sha256_hex`/`constant_time_str_eq` | Yes | Isolated from-scratch SHA-256, bit-verified. Output buffer leaks — see below. |
| `rand_seed`/`rand_f64`/`rand_gaussian` | Yes | Same algorithm as the interpreter, process-wide state — see below. |
| `Vector`/`Matrix`, fully | Yes | Two codegen strategies — see below. |
| `struct`/`enum`/`match`, non-affine payloads | Yes | Real LLVM types — see below. Affine payloads: no (Phase 4b). |
| `struct`/`enum`/`match` with an affine field/payload | No | Phase 4b, deferred (below) — a non-affine one compiles now. |
| `sandbox`/`stop` | No | Real, separate OS process — a larger scope than `thread`/`spawn` above, not touched by that update. |
| `file`/`open` | No | `docs/PROTOLANG_PORT.md`'s file I/O port. |
| `dec128` + `dec_*` builtins | No | Not yet in `Ty`/`codegen.rs`'s builtin allowlists. |
| `json`/`db`/`mq`, Row 12 identity/session/API-key builtins | No | Identity ones also blocked on `VerifiedIdentity`/`RoleView`/`ClaimView` being structs. |
| `http_get`/`http_post`/`https_get`/`https_post`, `mock_issue_token` | No | Not in `codegen.rs`'s builtin allowlists. |
| `transact` | No | |
| `workflow` | No | Desugars to `send_email`/`send_sms`/`send_push`/`notify`/`__workflow_*`, none compiled. |
| `fn(..)->..`/`acquire`/`requires(...)` | No | First-class/privileged functions (§6a). |
| `screen`/`dashboard` | Inert, not rejected | `codegen.rs` never inspects these — a program containing them compiles cleanly with nothing to lower to. |

**Scalar width mechanics.** Same LLVM widths as the signed types for
every unsigned counterpart; the one real signed-vs-unsigned instruction
choice is at the widen-on-load step (`zext` for unsigned, `sext` for
signed, `codegen.rs::widen_to_i64`) — every downstream `+`/`-`/`*`/
comparison/`/` is byte-identical between the two once correctly
widened, confirmed by compiling and running comparison/division/
boundary-value/underflow-trap programs for all five unsigned types, not
just reasoned about.

**`sha256_hex`.** Linked calls into a from-scratch SHA-256 in
`crates/compiler/src/runtime_kernels.rs` (isolated `rustc --crate-type
staticlib`, no `--extern` flags — that file can't reach `interpreter.rs`'s
`sha2` crate), verified bit-for-bit against the standard's own test
vectors, an independent Python `hashlib.sha256` cross-check at every
padding-boundary length, and the interpreter's own output. Its output
buffer is heap-allocated and never freed — `str` isn't affine, so
there's no scope-closing point to hook a `nir_free` onto (a real, small,
disclosed leak, not a silent one — `runtime_kernels.rs::
nir_sha256_hex`'s doc comment).

**RNG.** A per-thread (`thread_local!`) stream, not process-wide — fixed
2026-09, see §9 for the full story (it was briefly process-wide, which
became a real race once `thread`/`spawn` compiled). Calling `rand_f64`/
`rand_gaussian` before `rand_seed` **on that same thread** aborts the
process, matching the interpreter's `RngNotSeeded` in spirit, via
`abort()` instead of a catchable `Result`.

**`Vector`/`Matrix` — two codegen strategies**, worth knowing for
performance reasoning: shape-driven operations (elementwise ops, `*`,
`transpose`, `dot`, `cross`, `zeros`/`ones`/`identity`, `sum`, `len`,
the norms, `trace`, `is_*`, the geometry builtins, `kf_predict_*`) are
**fully unrolled at compile time** into straight-line IR — dimensions
are always compile-time literals, so this is always possible and more
optimizable than an equivalent runtime loop. The data-dependent ones
(`det`/`inv`/`solve`/`rank`/`kf_update_*` — partial-pivot row selection
is real, value-dependent control flow) instead **call into
`runtime_kernels.rs`**, reusing the interpreter's own proven algorithms
rather than a second copy. Not a performance compromise (a native
`call` costs what inlined IR costs), but a real, measured tradeoff
against hand-specialized C: the kernels are generic over matrix size
`n`, so they can't be specialized for a fixed small `n` the way C's
`det4()` can — `benchmarks/RESULTS.md`'s Group A "honest asterisk" has
the numbers (beats C on the unrolled operations, loses on the
runtime-library ones).

**`struct`/`enum`/`match`.** Construction is an ordinary `Expr::Call`
(no dedicated AST node); `match` gets a real LLVM `switch` on the
declaration-order variant tag for enum arms, a sequential `nir_str_eq`
chain (no native string switch) for `str` literal-pattern arms. Lowers
to a real named LLVM type: a struct to `{ field_lltys... }` (LLVM
computes real padding), an enum to a hand-rolled `{ i64 tag, [N x i64]
payload }` tagged union (`N` a compile-time word count, over-allocated
to fit every variant); generic instantiations get distinct mangled
names (`%Result$i64$str`). **Phase 4b, deferred:** a `struct`/`enum`
whose fields/payloads *transitively* contain an affine type (`box`/`&`/
`thread`/`chan`/`tcp`/`file`/`db`/`mq`) is still rejected — freeing an
affine field nested in a struct, or in a *live* enum variant's payload,
needs `ownership.rs`'s `FreeMap` generalized beyond its current
`Ty::Box`-only `still_owned_boxes`, plus a new `at_match_arm_end` entry
for match-bound affine payloads. `check_supported` names the reason,
same "reject, don't mis-compile" treatment as everything else here.

**For benchmarking**: a `Vector`/`Matrix` comparison against Julia is
now compiled-vs-JIT, not interpreter-vs-JIT (`benchmarks/RESULTS.md` —
all four Group A benchmarks now decisively beat Julia; the historical
interpreted numbers are kept there too, labeled). A benchmark touching
an affine-field `struct`/`enum`/`match`, `thread`/`chan`/`sandbox`,
`file`, `json`/`db`/`mq`, or any Row 12 identity builtin is still
necessarily interpreted — a non-affine `struct`/`enum`/`match`, and
`box`/`tcp`/`str`, no longer carry that caveat.

## 11. `screen`/`dashboard` — declarative UI DSL (Row 12, `emit-ui`/`serve` only)

`nirdosha emit-ui`/`nirdosha serve` already derive a full CRUD+dashboard
web UI from nothing but a program's `struct` declarations and its
`list_/create_/update_/delete_/get_<struct>` and `stat_/chart_<name>`
function-naming conventions (`crates/compiler/src/ui_gen.rs`) — no syntax
needed at all for the common case. `screen`/`dashboard` blocks are an
**optional, additive** layer on top of that inference, for the parts a
naming convention can't express: a friendlier title, a relabeled field,
or a custom action beyond plain create/update/delete. A `struct` with no
matching `screen` block behaves exactly as before — nothing about this
DSL is load-bearing for a program that never uses it.

```nirdosha
struct Product {
    id: i64,
    name: str,
    price_cents: i64,
    stock: i64,
}

fn list_product() -> Result(json, str) { ... }
fn create_product(p: Product) -> Result(i64, str) requires(role: "admin") { ... }
fn restock_product(id: i64) -> Result(i64, str) requires(role: "admin") { ... }

screen Product {
    title: "Catalog"
    field name {
        label: "Product Name"
        pattern: "^[A-Za-z0-9 ]+$"
    }
    field stock {
        min: 0
    }
    action "Restock +10" -> restock_product {
        style: "outlined"
        confirm: "Restock this product by 10 units?"
    }
}

dashboard {
    tile "Products" -> stat_product_count
    chart "By Price" -> chart_products_by_price
}
```

**Grammar** (see `docs/GRAMMAR.md`'s `screen_decl`/`dashboard_decl`
productions for the full EBNF): `screen`/`dashboard` are real reserved
keywords, top-level items like `struct`/`fn`. Inside a body, `field`/
`action`/`paginate`/`tile`/`chart` are **contextual** keywords — matched
by identifier text only in that one leading position, the same "keyword
only within this slot" treatment `requires(role: ...)`'s own `role`/
`claim` already get — so they stay ordinary identifiers everywhere else
(a struct field or param can still be named `action`, as
`examples/trade-finance/trade_finance.nir` already does). Every `key:
value` slot is an ordinary expression — `parse_expr()` handles a string
(`title: "Catalog"`), an int (`page_size: 25`), a bare function name
(`list: list_product`), or a call (`view: role("admin", "analyst")`)
alike, with no separate value grammar to learn.

**What's checked today** (existence/shape only — typeck, not the
parser):

| Key | Rule |
|---|---|
| `screen <Name>` | Must name a real `struct`. |
| `field <fname>` | Must name a real field of that struct. |
| `list`/`create`/`update`/`delete`, an `action`'s `->` target | Must resolve to a real function. |
| `view`/`edit` | Must be `role(...)`/`claim(...)` with string-literal args — the same shape `requires(...)` itself accepts. |
| `pattern` | String literal, valid regex; `str` field only. |
| `format` | One of a fixed set of named shapes (below); `str` field only. |
| `min`/`max` | Int/float literal; numeric field only. |
| `pattern` + `format` | May not both be declared on the same field. |
| `render` (Track E3) | Must be `"countdown"` (the only value with meaning so far); integer field only. |
| `dashboard`'s `tile`/`chart`/`visual` targets | Must resolve to real functions. |

**What `screen`/`dashboard` currently change in the generated UI**:

| Key | Effect | Default when absent |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | Overrides the nav label/heading/toast text. | The struct name. |
| `field <name> { label: "..." }` | Overrides that field's displayed label everywhere one is shown. | The raw field name. |
| `list`/`create`/`update`/`delete` | Overrides which function backs that slot. | `<kind>_<snake_case_struct_name>` convention. |
| `action "<label>" -> <fn> { style, confirm, show_result }` | Extra per-row button beyond the inferred CRUD set; calls `<fn>` with just the row's primary-key-shaped first param (same single-param shape a declared `delete` already uses); `window.confirm(...)`-gated when `confirm` is set. | — |
| `show_result: true` (Track E4) | Opens `<fn>`'s own JSON response, pretty-printed, in a modal on success — for a "Simulate"/"Test"/"Preview" action whose entire value *is* its return value (a rule-change dry run naming how many transactions it would affect, say), instead of the plain row-refresh every other action does. Typechecked: `<fn>` must return `Result(json, _)` whenever present. Same key, same modal, also works on a `workspace` `panel`'s own `action` (§15) — identical `action "<label>" -> <fn> { ... }` shape. | — |
| `field { view, edit }` | Role/claim visibility — enforced both client- *and* server-side (see below). | — |
| `field { pattern: "<regex>" }` / `field { min/max: ... }` | Constrains a `str`/numeric field's value on both `create_<S>` and `update_<S>` — a violation is rejected with a `400` naming the field, both as a native HTML5 attribute (client-side, cosmetic) and, the real boundary, in `serve.rs::check_field_validations` before the fn's own body ever runs. | — |
| `field { format: "..." }` | Sugar over `pattern` for a fixed, closed vocabulary — `"email"`, `"phone"`, `"date"`, `"url"`, `"uuid"` — expanded to the matching regex at typeck/`ui_gen` time (`ast::well_known_format_pattern`); anything else needs a hand-written `pattern`. | — |

`field { render: "countdown" }` (Track E3) is display-only, never a
validation rule the way `pattern`/`format`/`min`/`max` are — an integer
field (a unix-seconds deadline) renders as a live "23m left"/"2h 14m
left"/"OVERDUE" chip in a table cell instead of the raw number, ticking
down client-side off `Date.now()` on one shared page-wide timer (not one
per row), ~9 screens' worth of "SLA countdown"/"nearing SLA breach"
widgets across `SCREENS.md` this unblocks directly. Static-field
ticking, deliberately not a poll or a push mechanism — the deadline
value itself already comes down with the row exactly as it does today;
only that one field's *display* changes, entirely in the browser, no
new `serve.rs` route or network traffic at all. Named as a candidate for
future closed-vocabulary siblings, not designed here: `"badge"` (color a
zero-payload-enum field by variant) and `"progress"` (a 0–100 field as a
bar) — confirming `render` as a key is the right shape to extend later,
not a one-off hack for countdowns specifically.

**Field-level `view`/`edit` RBAC is real, both sides**: `ui_gen.rs`
computes `view_roles`/`view_claim`/`edit_roles`/`edit_claim` per field
and applies them to both the list/detail view and the create/update
form; `serve.rs` independently redacts every view-gated field to `null`
in every response (`redact_gated_fields`, including the generic
`/_nirdosha/table/<name>` route) and rejects (`403`) a real change to
an edit-gated field from an unauthorized caller
(`check_edit_gates`) — the client-side hide/disable is cosmetic
convenience, not the security boundary.

**What's parsed and typechecked but not yet wired into the generated
UI**: `paginate { page_size, total }`, `field { searchable, sortable }`,
form insert-vs-update auto-hide-primary-key behavior. Tracked, with the
reason each is still open, in `crates/compiler/UI_DSL_TODO.md`.

**Deliberate non-goals, closed by design**: `dashboard { chart ... }`
(naming-convention `chart_<name>` too) is still exactly one chart type,
an inline-SVG bar chart, forever — `dashboard { visual ... }` (Track E2,
below) is the escape hatch for graph/heatmap/timeline, not a change to
what `chart` itself does. No Recharts/D3/Victory-style external charting
dependency regardless. Still true independent of that: exactly four
built-in animations, fixed (§11b's `fade-in`/`slide-up`/`scale-in`/
`pop` — no custom `@keyframes`, no gesture/physics-based motion, nothing
like Framer Motion); and a fixed seven-kind form-control set
(`text`/`number`/`checkbox`/`select`/`struct`/`readonly`/`date` — no
rich text editor, color picker, drag-drop upload with preview,
autocomplete/typeahead, calendar/scheduler, or signature pad). Full
rationale in `crates/compiler/UI_DSL_TODO.md`'s "Deliberate non-goals" section.

### 11c. `dashboard { visual ... }` — graph, heatmap, timeline (Track E2)

`chart`'s one-inline-SVG-bar-chart limit (above) stays exactly as
closed as it always was. `visual "<label>" -> <fn> { render: "graph" |
"heatmap" | "timeline" }` is a second, separate `dashboard_item` kind
with no naming-convention equivalent — always explicitly declared,
since a render *kind* can't be inferred from a function name the way
`stat_`/`chart_` infer their kind. Reuses the ordinary `kv_entry`
grammar `screen`'s own body already has — no separate mini-language per
chart type.

`render`'s value is a closed, typechecked vocabulary
(`typeck.rs::check_render_expr`); each kind fixes its backing fn's
expected `json` shape, the same "the fn returns exactly this shape,
usually one `db_query` with the right column aliases" contract
`chart_<name>`'s `{label, value}[]` already establishes:

| `render` | Expected JSON shape |
|---|---|
| `"graph"` | `{"nodes": [{"id", "label", "risk"?}], "edges": [{"source", "target", "weight"?}]}` |
| `"heatmap"` | `[{"lat", "lng", "weight", "label"?}]` |
| `"timeline"` | `[{"ts", "label", "detail"?}]`, any order (client sorts by `ts`) |

Same `render` key, same closed vocabulary, also works inside a
`workspace`'s own `panel { ... }` (§15) — `panel "..." { render:
"timeline" }` renders that panel's rows as a timeline instead of a
plain table, reusing the exact same client-side render functions.

**Honest limits, not yet built, disclosed rather than silently
implied**: `"graph"`'s layout is a static circle (or concentric risk
rings, when every node carries a numeric `risk`) — no drag, no zoom, no
force-directed physics. `"heatmap"` is a binned density grid
(equirectangular bucketing into a fixed 12×8 grid) — no real basemap,
no map tiles, no borders. Neither has a node/edge or point count ceiling
enforced anywhere — a screen with a few dozen nodes/points is the
informal ceiling before either becomes visually unreadable.

### 11a. Identity role-mapping cache (`docs/ROADMAP.md` Track A item A6)

`requires(role: "compliance_officer")` and every `screen` field's
`view`/`edit` role gate only ever matched, historically, if the IdP
token's `roles` claim contained that *exact* string — no translation
layer, so a renamed IdP group or an app deployed against two IdPs with
different naming conventions would silently stop matching, with no
error. An ordinary admin-editable struct closes this gap, the same
"free CRUD screen, no new language surface" convention `EmailProvider
Config` (§14) already established:

```nirdosha
struct RoleMapping {
    id: i64,
    app_role: str,
    idp_role: str,
}
// + list_/create_/update_/delete_role_mapping fns, same shape as any
// other CRUD screen (see scratch/nirdosha_llm_prompt.md's standing
// fixture for a complete worked example).
```

`nirdosha serve --db <path>` loads every `(app_role, idp_role)` row of
`role_mapping` (if the table exists — a program that never declares
`RoleMapping` gets byte-for-byte the original literal-match-only
behavior) into an in-memory cache once at startup, then re-reads it at
most once every 30 seconds, on demand, the next time a request needs
it (never on a fixed background timer) — bounded staleness (an admin's
edit takes up to 30s to take effect), not real-time, the same disclosed
tradeoff `resolve_identity`'s own token-`expires_at` check already is.
Every `requires(role: ...)` check and every `screen` field's `view`/
`edit` gate now passes through this cache (`serve.rs::
identity_has_mapped_role`): the identity's raw token roles satisfy
`app_role` if they contain it *literally* (checked first, so a program
with no `RoleMapping` declared, or an identity whose token already uses
the app's own vocabulary, is completely unaffected) **or** if they
contain any `idp_role` the table maps to that `app_role`. One app role
may have more than one IdP-side synonym (e.g. migrating naming
conventions). This is `--db`-gated like every other `--db`-only feature
in this file — omit `--db` and role checks are exactly what they always
were, no mapping cache at all.

### 11b. Design-token theming: `--theme`, real motion/interaction, live reload

`--theme <path>` (`emit-ui`/`serve`) layers a per-project design system
on top of the baked-in Material Design 3 defaults — `ui_gen::Theme`
(`crates/compiler/src/ui_gen.rs`) is a 1:1 mirror of protobox's
`resolve_design_tokens(spec)` JSON shape (`be-v2/src/features/
design_studio/generate_palettes.py`): a project's `theme.json` **is**
that function's direct output, no hand-picked subset, no second
field-name vocabulary to keep in sync by hand. Every top-level section
(`brand`/`neutral` 11-step ramps, `fonts`, `radius`, `shadow_card`,
`density`, `motion`, `dark_mode`, `layout`, `type_scale`) is optional —
an absent section leaves those tokens at their MD3 defaults, so a
`.nir` app with no `--theme` at all renders exactly as it did before
this existed.

**What a theme actually changes**:
- **Color**: `brand`/`neutral` ramps resolve into the existing `--md-
  primary`/`--md-surface`/etc. custom properties via a fixed semantic-
  role → ramp-step mapping (light and dark steps chosen per role,
  `ui_gen.rs`'s own `RampRoleStep` table) — not sourced from a
  protobox internal file, an ordinary Tailwind-ramp convention chosen
  for this integration.
- **Motion**: real `@keyframes` (`fade-in`/`slide-up`/`scale-in`/
  `pop` — a fixed 4-name vocabulary, matching protobox's own "no other
  animate-* names exist" contract) drive a screen's entrance animation
  and a table's per-row staggered entrance (`--stagger-ms`, JS-computed
  `animation-delay` per row, same convention protobox's own React
  codegen prompt describes). Every interactive element (buttons, nav
  items, inputs, selects) gets real `transition`/`:hover`/
  `:focus-visible`/`:active`/`:disabled` states — hover lift+scale,
  press scale, driven by `--hover-lift-px`/`--hover-scale`/
  `--press-scale`. `motion: "none"` needs no special-casing anywhere:
  its duration/lift/scale values are all already zero/neutral, so
  every transition/animation using them is naturally instant/absent.
  `prefers-reduced-motion` is honored unconditionally, globally, with
  no DSL surface to opt in.
- **`dark_mode`** (`"none"`/`"media"`/`"class"`/`"always"`): `"media"`
  (the default when a ramp is set with no explicit strategy) keeps
  today's `prefers-color-scheme` block; `"class"` wraps the same
  overrides in `:root.dark` instead, plus a tiny inline bootstrap
  script (system-preference-only — no manual toggle control exists in
  this template) that adds the class before first paint; `"always"`
  writes the dark values directly into the base `:root` (no light
  variant at all); `"none"` emits no dark block regardless of ramp
  presence.
- **`layout.app_shell`/`content_width`**: CSS-only variants on the one
  fixed shell, applied via a static `<html class="...">` computed once
  at generation time (`ui_gen::theme_html_class`) — `"auto"`/absent
  keeps today's nav-rail + top-app-bar shell, byte-for-byte, for every
  `.nir` app that predates this field. `"topbar"` repositions the same
  nav rail into a horizontal bar; `"minimal"` hides it entirely for a
  centered single-column layout (protobox's own "auth-style" prose).
  `"boxed"`/`"fluid"` cap or uncap `main`'s width.

**Live reload**: `--theme <path>` used to be read once, at `nirdosha
serve` startup — a redeployed `theme.json` needed a full restart.
`serve.rs`'s `ThemeCache` now re-reads the file on `GET /`, at most
once per 30-second TTL (env-overridable for tests, same seam
`RoleMappingCache`'s TTL uses) — bounded staleness, the same disclosed
tradeoff the role-mapping cache above already takes. A missing file, an
I/O error, or a `theme.json` that doesn't parse (an editor's
half-written save) is tolerated: logged to stderr, the last-good page
kept serving, never a crash or a broken response.

## 12. `module "Name" { ... }` — nav grouping, not scoping

**This section covers the legacy, string-named form only — completely
unaffected by, and unrelated to, the real namespace/`pub`/`use` system
§17 adds.** `parser.rs` tells the two forms apart by the very next
token after `module` (a string literal here; a bare identifier for
§17's real form) — nothing about this section's behavior changed when
that was added.

`emit-ui`'s nav is one flat list of screens by default. A `module "Display
Name" { ... }` block wrapping `fn`/`struct`/`enum` declarations tags each
one with that display name — `ui_gen.rs` groups nav screens by it into
collapsible primary-menu sections; `Dashboard` always stays outside every
group, first. That is the *only* thing this form of `module` does: it is
**pure syntactic sugar**, not a namespace. Everything inside it still
registers into the exact same single flat global namespace a top-level
declaration would (`typeck.rs` never even inspects it — only `ui_gen.rs`
does), so two functions in different string-named `module` blocks can call
each other exactly as freely as two top-level ones always could, and a
program that never uses `module` at all renders exactly as it did before
this construct existed (flat, ungrouped nav).

```nirdosha
module "Billing" {
    struct Invoice { id: i64, amount_cents: i64, status: str }
    fn list_invoice() -> Result(json, str) { ... }
    fn create_invoice(inv: Invoice) -> Result(i64, str) { ... }
}

module "Shipping" {
    struct Shipment { id: i64, invoice_id: i64, carrier: str }
    fn list_shipment() -> Result(json, str) { ... }
}
```

**Grammar** (`docs/GRAMMAR.md`'s `module_decl`): `module` is a real reserved
keyword, dispatched like `struct`/`enum`/`screen`/`dashboard`, followed by
a string display name (not an `ident` — needs to hold spaces/punctuation
like `"B2B Trade Payments & Commission Engine"`), then a brace-delimited
list of `fn`/`struct`/`enum` declarations — each parsed by the exact same
`parse_fn_decl`/`parse_struct_decl`/`parse_enum_decl` the top level itself
uses. Single-level only: a `module` nested inside a `module`, or a
`screen`/`dashboard` inside one, is a parse error — the same fixed-arity,
no-arbitrary-nesting discipline `transact` slots already have (`screen`/
`dashboard` stay top-level-only declarations, since they're UI-specific
authoring, not business-organizational).

## 13. Auto-generated DB schema migrations (`nirdosha serve --db`)

Before this, every table was created by a hand-written, literal
`db_execute(conn, "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...")` inside individual
`.nir` functions — duplicated per function, never derived from the
`struct` itself, and never updated when a struct gained a field. `nirdosha
serve --db <path>` now derives schema from `struct` field declarations
directly and keeps it current automatically, once at every startup — no
new syntax, no new flag, just behavior layered on the `--db` flag that
already existed.

**What runs at startup, only when `--db` is given:** for every top-level
`struct` (skipping the built-in prelude structs), the declared fields are
diffed against the live SQLite schema:

- table doesn't exist yet → `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <table> (<cols>)`
- table exists but is missing a column for some field → one `ALTER TABLE
  <table> ADD COLUMN ...` per missing field
- nothing missing → nothing happens (the common case on every
  steady-state restart)

Field type → SQL column type:

| Field type | SQL column | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `I8/16/32/64`/`U8/16/32/64`/`Usize` | `INTEGER` | |
| `F64` | `REAL` | |
| `Bool` | `INTEGER` | 0/1, matching `db_execute`'s own existing encoding. |
| `Str` | `TEXT` | |
| `Option(T)` | Same as `T` | SQLite columns are nullable by default — no distinct shape needed. |
| Zero-payload enum | `TEXT` | The variant name — same round-trip `sql_bind_params`/`decode_enum_value` already give a plain `db_execute`/`db_query` call. |
| A field literally named `id`, type `i64` | `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT` | The convention every hand-written schema in this codebase already follows. |

**Deliberately additive-only.** A struct field whose type has no
single-column SQL shape (a nested struct, `Vector`/`Matrix`, a
payload-carrying enum, an affine handle like `db`/`tcp`/`box`) causes that
struct's table to be skipped *entirely* — never a partial table — logged
as a warning naming the struct and field. A column whose type changed, or
whose field was removed from the struct, is **not** touched automatically
(SQLite can't safely change a column's type without a full table rebuild,
and dropping a column automatically at an unattended startup is a real
data-loss risk) — also just a warning, never attempted. A table with no
backing `struct` at all (hand-written SQL with no matching declaration) is
completely untouched, exactly as before this feature existed.

**Every applied change is written to disk first**, at
`<sibling-of---db-path>/migrations/NNNN_<slug>.sql` (`create_<table>` /
`alter_<table>_add_<col>...`, sequential across a single startup's run) —
a reviewable, commit-to-git audit trail, not a rollback-capable ledger:
there are no down-migrations, and these files are a generated record of
what ran, not something meant to be hand-authored or edited. A small
`_nirdosha_migrations` table inside the database itself separately
records `(filename, applied_at, sql)` for a DB inspected on its own.

Omitting `--db` leaves an app exactly as it always behaved — this
feature, like the `/_nirdosha/table/<name>` route it shares its
`--db`-gating with, only exists at all once that flag is passed.

---

## 14. `workflow` — durable state machines with notification actions

Full design in `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (locked grammar, runtime protocol, deliberate
non-goals) — this section is the short version.

`workflow Name { data { ... } state ... }` is a durable, named state
machine: `state`s, `on <Event> -> <Target>` transitions (optionally
`link`-marked for an unauthenticated, single-use magic-link trigger), and
`on_entry`/`on_exit` action calls that can reach the new notification
builtins (`send_email`/`send_sms`/`send_push`/`notify`). Like `module`
(§12), it's **pure desugaring, not a new runtime primitive**:
`workflow_lower.rs` turns every `workflow` block into ordinary `fn`/
`enum`/`struct` declarations (a `start_*`, an `advance_*`, one
`<event>_via_link` per `link`-marked transition, plus a synthesized
`<Workflow>Event` enum and `<Workflow>Data` struct) right after parsing —
every later pass, including `nirdosha serve`'s automatic
`POST /api/<fn>` RPC exposure, sees only those, never `workflow` syntax
itself. A program that declares no `workflow` is byte-for-byte unaffected.

One thing this does **not** do, worth stating plainly since it's easy to
assume: it does not add WebSocket support to this codebase (`notify`'s
real-time path is a Redis `PUBLISH` an external gateway is expected to
relay — see `docs/WORKFLOW.md`). `on_entry`/`on_exit` actions *are*
crash-durable, the same "log intent before running it, replay on
restart" shape `transact`'s own `network` slot already has
(`WorkflowLog::begin_pending_action`, `Interpreter::
replay_pending_workflow_actions` — called at `nirdosha serve` startup
right alongside `replay_pending_transactions`).

Interpreter-only, the same way `transact`/`db`/`mq` already are (§10):
`workflow`-desugared functions call builtins outside `codegen.rs`'s
`PHASE4_BUILTINS`/`PHASE5_BUILTINS`/... allowlists, so `nirdosha build`/
`emit-llvm` cleanly rejects a program using `workflow`, naming the
specific unsupported builtin — never a silent mis-compile.

**Generated UI: a real stage stepper, not a bare state-name badge**
(Track E5, `docs/ROADMAP.md`) — `nirdosha serve`'s workflow queue screen
(the same `list_<workflow>_pending_for_me`/`list_<workflow>_
submitted_by_me` queue described above) renders each row's own `state`
as a `●━●━○━○`-style horizontal stepper against the workflow's full
declared `state` list, not just that one row's current name. No syntax
change — the declared `state` order was already parsed; this is purely
`ui_gen.rs` carrying that ordered list into the manifest for
`ui_gen_template.html` to draw against.

## 15. `workspace`/`panel` — composite multi-panel screens (Row 12, `emit-ui`/`serve` only)

Full design in `examples/ctms/UI_CONSTRUCTS.md` §1 (`docs/ROADMAP.md` Track
E1) — this section is the short version.

`screen <Struct> { ... }` (§11) is fundamentally one-struct-shaped: its
fields come from that one struct, its actions are that struct's own CRUD
functions. Some real screens genuinely need fields and lists from
*several* structs composed onto one page, all scoped to one instance —
an investigation view showing a case's own fields alongside its
transactions, its alerts, and its notes, say. `workspace` is that:

```nirdosha
workspace CaseInvestigation {
    title: "Investigation Workspace"     // optional; defaults to a
                                          // display-cased `CaseInvestigation`
    subject: Case                        // must have an `id: i64` field

    panel "Transactions" {
        source: list_transaction_for_case   // fn(i64) -> Result(json, _)
    }
    panel "Notes" {
        source: list_case_note
        action "Add Note" -> add_case_note {
            style: "filled"
        }
    }
}
```

`subject: <Struct>` names the struct this workspace is opened per
instance of — every panel's `source` is called with that instance's
`id`. Reachable at `#/ws/case_investigation/<id>` once signed in; a
"Workspaces" nav entry (`#/ws/case_investigation`, no id) shows a picker
— literally `subject`'s own already-derived screen and table, so it gets
that screen's real pagination/sort/search for free when
`--db`/`SERVER_TABLE_API` is on — and every row on `subject`'s own
ordinary screen also gets an "Open Workspace" button straight to its
instance.

**`source`'s required shape**: exactly one `i64` parameter, returning
`Result(json, _)` — the same shape check `typeck.rs::check_workspace`
enforces before `ui_gen` ever runs. Whatever that fn returns (an array
of objects, typically — a plain `db_query` result works unmodified) is
rendered as a plain table, columns inferred from the first row's own
keys; there's no declared field list for a panel the way a screen's own
`FieldSpec`s exist, since a panel's shape is whatever its own query
returns, not a struct's declared fields.

A panel's `action "<label>" -> <fn> { ... }` is `screen`'s own
`action_decl` reused completely unchanged. **Convention**: a panel
action's first parameter is always treated as this workspace instance's
own id — pre-filled, never rendered as an input, the same "sole id
param, hidden" treatment a screen's own delete/custom row actions
already give theirs; every other parameter renders as an ordinary form
field. A successful action reloads just that one panel.

**What this does not add**: no new `serve.rs` route, no new server-side
trust boundary — every panel's `source` and every panel action are
ordinary already-`requires(...)`-gated `.nir` functions already exposed
at `POST /api/<fn>`, exactly as any other screen's actions are. A
workspace is a client-side *composition* of calls that already exist and
are already secured. `panel "..." { render: "graph" | "heatmap" |
"timeline" }` (Track E2, §11c) upgrades a panel from its default plain
table to one of those three richer visualizations, same closed
vocabulary and same honest limits (static graph layout, binned
heatmap grid, no basemap) §11c discloses for `dashboard { visual ... }`.

Like `module`/`workflow`, a program that declares no `workspace` is
byte-for-byte unaffected.

## 16. `validate` — Hoare contracts on a function (`docs/ROADMAP.md` Track F, F3)

Full design in `docs/NEXT_GEN.md` §F3 — this section is the short version.

`requires(role: "...")`/`requires(claim: ..., ...)` (§6) gate *who* may
call a function. `validate` is a different, orthogonal thing: it states
a fact the function itself must honor, checked two ways at once.

```nirdosha
fn max_of(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    if a > b { return a }
    return b
}

validate max_of {
    post: result >= a
    post: result >= b
}
```

`pre: <expr>` — a hypothesis about the arguments, asserted before the
function runs at all. `post: <expr>` — a fact about `result` (a
reserved name bound to the real return value, meaningful only inside a
`post`) that must hold whenever the function returns. Multiple `pre`/
`post` entries are meaningful: every `pre` is a conjunctive hypothesis,
every `post` is checked independently, so a violation names exactly
which clause failed. `pre`/`post` are ordinary `kv_entry`s, not new
syntax — their value is `expr`, the same grammar every other value
position already uses.

**Two independent enforcement paths, not one:**

| | Static, at build time | Dynamic, at runtime |
|---|---|---|
| Runs | `nirdosha build`/`run`/`serve`/`emit-ui` | Every actual call, unconditionally |
| Basis | A genuine Z3 proof, not a heuristic | The real concrete argument/return values |
| Scope | Tier 1 only: integer params/return, no loop, no division in the checked function. A `Call` is supported too, but only when *that* callee's own `validate` contract is *already independently proven* — its proof is reused as a fact about the result (`pre` implies `post`, never `post` alone, so a call site that doesn't itself satisfy the callee's precondition gets an uninformative axiom, never a wrong one). A call to an unproven/undeclared callee still falls through to the runtime path — never a guess. | None of the static pass's restrictions — the only enforcement path for a function touching `db`/`json`/`http`, calling another function, or looping, which in practice is most real functions. |
| On failure | Hard build failure, naming a real counterexample | `pre` stops the body from running at all; `post` reports the real return value that violated it |
| Can't decide | Falls through to the runtime path (`Unsupported`) — `nirdosha emit-ui`/`serve` print a `note:` explaining why | Treated as a violation, never silently passed (a predicate that errors evaluating, or isn't boolean-shaped) |

A function with no `validate` block is byte-for-byte unaffected by
either path — same "declares nothing, changes nothing" posture
`workspace`/`workflow`/`module` already hold themselves to.

**What this doesn't do.** Interprocedural reasoning only ever chains one
level deep through *proven* summaries — a call into a function whose
own contract is itself only provable *using another as-yet-unproven
callee's* summary won't resolve on the first pass, though a real
multi-pass fixed point (`contract_check::run_program_validates`) does
let a short chain of provable functions bootstrap each other; genuine
mutual recursion between two `validate`d functions still never resolves
on either side, honestly, not a wrong answer. `pre`/`post` are now
type-checked against the target function's real signature ahead of
time (`typeck::check_validate`) — a badly-shaped predicate is a
build-time diagnostic regardless of whether the target function is in
Tier-1's provable subset at all. Full detail on both:
`docs/ROADMAP.md` Track F, F3.

## 17. Real namespacing, `pub`, and `use` (`docs/ROADMAP.md` Track F, F2)

Full design reasoning in `docs/NEXT_GEN.md` §F2 — this section is the short,
practical version. Unrelated to §12's `module "Display Name" { ... }`
form, which this doesn't change at all: `parser.rs` tells the two apart
by the token right after `module` (a string vs. a bare identifier), so
every existing `.nir` program keeps parsing byte-for-byte identically.

**The problem this closes.** Before this, every `struct`/`enum`/`fn`
name in a program — prelude included — lived in one single flat
namespace. A user `struct Pair` collided with the prelude's own `Pair`;
any two enums anywhere in a program sharing a variant name (`SAR`, say,
against the prelude `CurrencyCode`'s own `SAR`) was an unconditional
`DuplicateConstructor` error, with no way to opt out.

```nirdosha
module Audit {
    pub struct Entry {
        id: i64,
    }
    struct Internal {
        secret: i64,
    }
    pub fn make(id: i64) -> Audit::Entry {
        return Audit::Entry(id)
    }
}

fn main() -> i64 {
    let e: Audit::Entry = Audit::make(1)
    return e.id
}
```

`module Ident { ... }` (a bare identifier, not a string) is a **real
namespace** — every declaration inside registers under its own
qualified key (`Audit::Entry`, not bare `Entry`), so it can share a
short name with the prelude, or with another module's declaration,
with zero collision. `pub` marks a declaration visible from outside its
own module; omitted, it's private (visible only via its own module's
qualified self-reference). An optional `nav: "Display Name"` line right
after the `{` sets the same nav-grouping string §12's form sets
directly, defaulting to the identifier itself.

**The one real ergonomic cost, deliberate, not an oversight:** a
namespaced declaration is reachable **only** by its qualified form,
`Mod::Name` — never bare, *even from a sibling declaration inside the
very same module*. `Audit::make` above has to write `Audit::Entry`, not
bare `Entry`, to name its own module's struct. This is what makes
adding a namespace incapable of ever introducing a *new* ambiguity: a
bare reference always means exactly what it meant before this feature
existed (the one non-namespaced declaration of that name, if any,
completely unaffected by how many namespaced ones with the same short
name also exist), and a qualified one is unambiguous by construction.
An enum variant follows the identical rule, spelled `Enum::Variant` (or
`Mod::Enum::Variant` for a namespaced enum) in both construction and a
`match` arm — `SAR(...)` alone always means whichever *non-namespaced*
enum has a bare `SAR`, `Mine::ReportType::SAR()` always means that
specific namespaced one, and the two can never collide.

**`use "relative/path.nir"`** — only legal in the leading run at the
very top of a file, before any other item — imports another file's
`pub`, namespaced declarations into the importing program. A
non-namespaced (top-level) declaration in the imported file, or a
namespaced one that isn't `pub`, never crosses the file boundary — the
imported file is typechecked completely on its own first (its own
diagnostics, at its own file's line:col), so anything it exports is
already known-sound before it's merged in. Two different files each
declaring the same module identifier is a real, reported collision, not
a silent overwrite; an import cycle is a clean error, not a hang. This
is wired into every command that actually loads a `.nir` file from disk
(`nirdosha <file>`, `build`, `emit-llvm`, `emit-ui`, `serve`,
`--sandbox-worker`) — `nirdosha <file> --format=json`'s structured
`--format=json` diagnostics are the one disclosed exception, not yet
`use`-aware (`docs/NEXT_GEN.md` §F2's own risk register).

**What's still `[OPEN]`, disclosed rather than silently unsupported:**
a `screen`/`dashboard`/`workflow`/`workspace` block can't reference a
namespaced struct — those stay top-level-only in this pass; the
*compiled* path (`nirdosha build`/`emit-llvm`) rejects a program
containing any real-namespace declaration outright (a clear, named
error, not a miscompile) — same incremental-porting posture §10's
compiled-vs-interpreted table already documents for `db`/`json`/`http`/
etc. A program using no `module Ident { }`/`pub`/`use` at all — every
existing `.nir` file — is completely unaffected by any of this.

## 18. `layout { ... }` — composable screen arrangement (`docs/ROADMAP.md` Track F, F4)

Full design reasoning in `docs/NEXT_GEN.md` §F4 — this section is the
short, practical version. A `screen <Struct> { ... }` block's fields and
actions used to render as one flat, implicit top-to-bottom list — no
grouping, no columns, no tabs. `layout { ... }`, declared inside a
`screen` block, is an optional arrangement tree on top of that same
field/action set — the first construct in this language that can nest
inside itself.

```nirdosha
screen Case {
    action "Escalate" -> escalate_case

    layout {
        row {
            column {
                group "Details" {
                    field case_number
                    field status
                    field priority
                }
                divider {}
                group "Assignment" {
                    field assigned_to
                }
            }
            column {
                tabs {
                    tab "History" {
                        timeline { source: list_case_history }
                    }
                    tab "Actions" {
                        action "Escalate"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`row`/`column`/`grid` arrange their children horizontally, vertically,
or in a fixed-column grid (`grid { columns: 3 ... }`); `group "Title" {
... }` is a titled (optionally `collapsible: true`) box; `tabs { tab
"Label" { ... } ... }` switches between panels. `field <name>` and
`action "<label>"` **reference** — never duplicate — the screen's own
existing `field`/`action` declarations by name; a name that doesn't
resolve is a real, `screen`-block-style type error
(`typeck::check_screen_layout`), the same "existence/shape checked, not
guessed" posture every other DSL slot here already has. `field`/
`action` overrides you'd already write (`view`/`edit`/`pattern`/
`render`/...) stay exactly where they are today, outside `layout` — a
`layout` block only decides *where* something renders, never *what* it
is. A screen with no `layout` block renders exactly as it always has
(the flat list) — this is purely additive.

**The widget vocabulary, this phase**: `divider {}`, `card { title:
"..." }`, and `timeline { source: <fn> }` (a live activity/audit feed,
reusing the same rendering `dashboard`/`workspace` visuals already have
for `render: "timeline"`). Two more widgets ship as `field` overrides,
not `layout` leaves, since they're about one specific field, not a
standalone box:

- `field <name> { render: "badge" }` — an enum-typed field (zero-payload
  variants) shown as a colored pill instead of plain text, in table
  cells. Color is deterministic (hashed from the variant name), not
  per-variant configurable yet.
- `field <name> { render: "searchable_select" source: <Struct|fn> }` —
  a text-input-driven dropdown with debounced search and scroll-
  triggered pagination (load more as you scroll, not numbered pages).
  `source: <Struct>` reuses the same generic `/_nirdosha/table/<table>`
  route `nirdosha serve --db` already exposes for the main list screen
  — real search plus real pagination, no backend code to write.
  `source: <fn>` calls that function directly instead — one search,
  unpaginated, the fallback when there's no `--db` or the struct's real
  list logic is hand-written.

**Styling**: every element still renders with the same default look
(`--theme` JSON, app-wide tokens) `screen`/`dashboard` already use.
A per-element `css: "..."` raw-CSS override is planned (Phase C, not
shipped yet) — deliberately scoped to the web renderer only: a future
non-web renderer (TUI/native mobile, `docs/NEXT_GEN.md` §F1) would
simply ignore it, the same way this project already treats `db`/`json`/
`http` as web/interpreter-only rather than blocking on a portable
equivalent existing first.

**What's still `[OPEN]`**: the remaining widget catalog (`progress`,
`multi_select`, date/time pickers, `checkbox_group`/`radio_group`,
`toggle`, `slider`, `breadcrumb`, `stepper`, and more); the `css:`
escape hatch itself; and `searchable_select` for a `list_<Struct>` fn
whose real logic isn't the generic table route (needs its own future
`search:` parameter convention). A program using no `layout { }` block
at all — every existing `.nir` file as of this writing — is completely
unaffected by any of this.
