Status: a real, runnable Rust compiler (`crates/compiler/`) under
active development — many safety properties are *proven* today, and
where one is still *aspirational* the [wiki](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki/Honest-Scope-and-Roadmap)
says so plainly. Source files use the `.nir` extension.

```nirdosha
fn secret(n: i64) -> i64 requires(role: "admin") {
    return n + 1
}

fn work(b: box i64) -> i64 {
    return *b
}

fn main() {
    print("hello, Nirdosha")
    let h: box i64 = box 21
    let t: thread i64 = spawn work(h)
    print(join t)
}
```

```sh
cd crates/compiler && cargo run -- ../../examples/hello_above_fold.nir
# hello, Nirdosha
# 21
```

`box` is single-owner — `spawn` moves `h` into the thread, so `main` can
never touch it again; that's checked at compile time, not by convention.
`secret` is gated by `requires(role: "admin")` and is literally uncallable
without an `acquire`d `RoleView` proof — see
[`examples/privileged_fn.nir`](./examples/privileged_fn.nir) for the full
role-acquisition flow.

![334 lines of Nirdosha producing a themed dashboard with live SQLite data, a sortable/searchable vendor table, and a role-gated payout-approval action — then the same screens under a lower-privileged identity, with a field dropped and an action disabled by the server](./demo.gif)

*334 lines, zero UI code — `examples/vendor_ops.nir`, verified with
`wc -l`. `nirdosha serve examples/vendor_ops.nir --theme
examples/vendor_ops_theme.json` derives a live dashboard, a
sortable/searchable table, and a role-gated `Approve` action from two
`struct`s and a `screen`/`dashboard` block. Signed in as `analyst`, the
exact same screen drops the `risk_score` field and column entirely and
disables `Approve` — both enforced by `serve.rs` on every call, not
hidden by client JS. Signed in as `admin`, that same `Approve` action
really flips a row from `requested` to `approved` in SQLite. Nothing here
is simulated — see the [UI Engine](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki/UI-Engine)
and [Honest Scope](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki/Honest-Scope-and-Roadmap)

## Current focus / how to help

Small team, high-context contributions matter more than volume — see
[`MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md) for who has write access and how
active each is. Right now:

- **Track B (full compilation) — now the only path to running any of
  this, not a latency/throughput nice-to-have.** The interpreter (`run`/
  `serve`) has been removed entirely, by deliberate decision, so that
  the compiled path can't quietly stay second-class. Native codegen only
  covers the numeric/control-flow/`tcp`/`file` subset today —
  `db`/`json`/`http`/`mq`/identity/`transact`/concurrency don't run at
  all right now, in any form, until each gets real codegen (see
  [ROADMAP](./docs/PUBLIC_ROADMAP.md)). First gap to close: `transact` →
  `db`/`json`.
- **macOS verification** — release binaries link system Z3 because
  `z3-src` doesn't build against current AppleClang ([ADR
  0001](./docs/adr/0001-vendor-z3-except-macos.md), tracked as
  [issue #5](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/issues/5)) — that part
  is still open. What's now closed: macOS gets CI verification on every
  push/PR, not just at release time. `build-macos` in
  [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](./.github/workflows/build.yml) mirrors
  release.yml's proven `brew install z3` + system-Z3 build on a real
  `macos-14` runner. Windows is CI-verified too: `build-windows` in the
  same file builds and runs the `tcp` suite plus the compiled-native-
  codegen TCP tests on a real `windows-latest` runner on every push/PR
  (see [ROADMAP A7](./docs/PUBLIC_ROADMAP.md)).

Full list with status tags: [`docs/PUBLIC_ROADMAP.md`](./docs/PUBLIC_ROADMAP.md).
Issues are labeled `good first issue` / `help wanted` / `compiler` /
`llm` / `infra` / `documentation` (full set: [`.github/labels.yml`](./.github/labels.yml)).
Pick one, comment before starting on anything non-trivial — see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md). [`AREAS.md`](./AREAS.md) lists
who owns which subsystem; a cross-cutting or breaking change goes
through the [RFC process](./rfcs/README.md) first — see
[`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md). Your first issue or PR here won't
land in silence: [`welcome.yml`](./.github/workflows/welcome.yml) posts
a real, specific reply (not boilerplate) and
[`label-first-contribution.yml`](./.github/workflows/label-first-contribution.yml)
tags it `first-time contributor` so it's visible at a glance — it
doesn't solve cold-start on its own, but it's a real signal in place of
nothing.

| If you care about | Try | 
|---|---|
| Ownership/concurrency, PL theory | A `Track B` codegen gap, or an SMT/typeck edge case |
| Constrained decoding, agent repair loops | `crates/bench/` harness + real models, `crates/grammar_export/` corpus entries |
| Real backends, CRUD, sandboxing | A new `examples/*.nir` service, or Track A production-readiness items |
| Docs / DX | Error-message clarity, Getting Started walkthroughs, missing examples |

## Why this exists, in one paragraph

Nirdosha targets one specific, currently-unsolved problem: **a backend
service written and maintained by an AI coding agent, with no human
reviewing every line before it runs.** An LL(1) grammar exported to GBNF
lets a sampler force every token an agent emits to stay syntactically
valid; `--format=json` gives a self-repair loop a structured proof
obligation instead of a paragraph to guess at; `sandbox` is a real OS
process and a language primitive, not a bolted-on Docker wrapper; there is
no mutex in the language, so an agent literally cannot generate a
lock-ordering deadlock — and the one deadlock class that *is* still
expressible (every thread mutually blocked on `chan`/`thread`, with no
lock involved at all) is caught at runtime and aborted with a diagnostic
naming the stuck handles, not left to hang forever. It isn't trying to
be a better Rust — see the
[wiki](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki) for the full case,
including where the design is still evolving, not a finished product.

## Who this is for — and who it isn't

**This is for you if:**
- You're building an agent (or agent framework) that writes and runs
  backend code with no human reviewing it before it executes, and you
  need the *language* to make bug classes unrepresentable rather than
  catching them in review.
- You want to try the constrained-decoding mechanism on a real compiler
  today, not a whitepaper — the GBNF grammar and `emit-ast`'s structured
  diagnostics run now, against the compiled path.
- You're fine filing issues against a fast-moving pre-1.0 project, not
  pulling a finished 1.0 into a production stack.

**This isn't for you if:**
- You want a general-purpose systems language for humans to write —
  that's Rust, and Rust is the honest answer (see the FAQ below).
- You need `db`/`json`/`http`/`mq` at all — there is no interpreter
  fallback anymore, and none of these compile to native code yet either,
  so none of it runs in any form until Track B lands (see
  [ROADMAP](./docs/PUBLIC_ROADMAP.md)). Basic concurrency (`spawn`/
  `join`/`thread`, `chan`/`send`/`recv`) does compile now — `sandbox`
  still doesn't.
- You need something production-ready this quarter — nothing here
  claims that.

## Nirdosha vs. Rust, Go, Mojo — the one-line version

| | **Nirdosha** | **Rust** | **Go** | **Mojo** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Target use case | LLM-written backend services, compliance CRUD | General-purpose systems | Cloud-native services | AI/ML-first, Python-compatible |
| Data-race freedom | Static | Static | Dynamic only | Not yet fully guaranteed |
| Deadlock freedom | No mutex primitive exists at all (lock-order deadlocks unrepresentable); a `chan`/`thread` global stall is dynamically detected and aborted, not left to hang | Possible | Possible | Not a current guarantee |
| LLM writability | LL(1) grammar exported to GBNF for constrained decoding | LLMs default to Python 90–97% of the time | No constrained decoding built in | No published GBNF integration |

[wiki](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki/Nirdosha-vs-Alternatives).

## Try it in under a minute

**Don't want to learn the syntax first?** Paste
[`agent-skills/nirdosha/paste-anywhere-prompt.md`](./agent-skills/nirdosha/paste-anywhere-prompt.md)
into any LLM chat and describe what you want in plain English — it writes
the `.nir` code for you. This prompt has already been used, unmodified, to
generate a working e-commerce store, a food-delivery platform, a telecom
revenue-assurance system, and an online trading platform, each hundreds of
lines, each by an LLM with no prior Nirdosha exposure. See
[LLM Integration](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki/LLM-Integration)
for the full mechanism and evidence.

**Install and run it yourself — no compiler needed, prebuilt binaries are
published on every [release](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/releases):**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha.git && cd nirdosha

# macOS / Linux — installer script, auto-detects your platform
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/main/scripts/install.sh | sh

nirdosha examples/hello.nir
nirdosha serve examples/store.nir --port 8080   # CRUD API from a struct
```

Prefer not to pipe a script into `sh`? Download the binary straight from
the release instead — `.../releases/latest/download/<asset>` always
resolves to the newest release, so this stays correct with no version
number to update. Run this from inside the `nirdosha` clone from above:

```sh
# Linux x86_64
curl -fsSL https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/releases/latest/download/nirdosha-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz | tar xz

# macOS, Apple Silicon
curl -fsSL https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/releases/latest/download/nirdosha-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz | tar xz

./nirdosha examples/hello.nir
```

These two targets are what's currently published; Windows and Intel
Mac binaries aren't up yet (build from source below in the meantime) —
the [releases page](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/releases/latest)
has the current full asset list.

Full install (Windows, building from source, toolchain requirements),
scaffolding a new project, and generating a UI: see

in the wiki.

### Before you write your own program

The example above runs as-is, but these four things will trip up your
*first original line* — they're parse/type errors, not style nits:

- **Enum variants are calls, always with `()`.** `Some(5)`, `None()`,
  `Circle(r)` — a zero-payload variant still needs the parens.
  `Color::Red` also works (optional disambiguation sugar), but a bare
  variant name never takes the place of a call.
- **`str` can't be a function's parameter or return type.** Use an
  `enum` for categorical data, or `struct Text { value: str }` to pass
  free text.
- **No string concatenation or formatting.** A `str` value only ever
  comes from a source literal or a builtin (`json_get_str`,
  `db_query`, ...) — there's no `+` or format string to build one at
  runtime.
- **No statement separators.** The parser always extends the current
  expression across a newline — `return x` then `-y` on the next line
  parses as `return (x - y)`, not two statements.

Full rationale and the complete list: [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## FAQ (short version)

**Is it production-ready?** Not yet — it's under active development,
with real guarantees proven today and the rest tracked openly, not
hand-waved. See [Honest Scope & Roadmap](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki/Honest-Scope-and-Roadmap).

**Why not just use Rust?** Rust already solves memory safety for teams
that can invest in its learning curve. Nirdosha targets a narrower
problem — AI agents writing backend code unsupervised. See the
[full answer](https://github.com/arunsoman/nirdosha/wiki/Nirdosha-vs-Alternatives).

**Found a bug?** Run `nirdosha <file.nir> --format=json` and paste the
`Diagnostic` JSON into a GitHub issue. Security issue? See
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) instead.

**Want to contribute?** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). More in
