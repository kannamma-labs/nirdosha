//! Effect inference — `docs/goal.md`'s "Effects" synthesis layer (rows 4, 9),
//! `docs/PROTOLANG_PORT.md`'s "Locked design 1". Computes every function's real
//! effect set (`ast::Effect`) by walking its body — the same "each pass
//! redoes its own minimal shadow walk over the AST" idiom `refine.rs`/
//! `smt.rs` already establish, not because this distrusts `typeck.rs`'s
//! result (a program reaching here already type-checked cleanly), but
//! because every `let`/param binding's type is already syntactically
//! explicit in this language (no local type inference to redo — see
//! `docs/LANGUAGE.md`'s grammar), so there's nothing to *infer* about a local
//! binding's type, only to look up.
//!
//! Computed unconditionally for every function, whether or not it declared
//! an `effect(...)` annotation — `typeck::typecheck` is the one that
//! checks a declared annotation against this pass's result
//! (`TypeErrorKind::EffectNotDeclared`); this module only computes, never
//! rejects.
//!
//! ## Classification
//!
//! | Effect | Comes from |
//! |---|---|
//! | `pure` (the empty set) | everything not listed below |
//! | `rng` | `rand_seed`/`rand_f64`/`rand_gaussian` |
//! | `io` | `print`; `file`'s `open`/`send`/`recv`/`stop`; `db_connect`/
//! `db_query`/`db_execute` (SQLite) |
//! | `concurrent` | `spawn`/`join`; `chan`'s `send`/`recv`; `sandbox`/`stop` |
//! | `network` | `connect`/`listen`/`accept`; `tcp`'s `send`/`recv`/`stop`;
//! `mq_connect`/`mq_publish`/`mq_consume`; `db_connect` when its
//! connection-string argument is (or might be, per `db_connect_effect`)
//! Postgres |
//!
//! `spawn`/`sandbox` also inherit whatever the spawned function's own
//! effect set is (transitively) — the *caller* triggered that work, even
//! though it now runs on another thread/process.
//!
//! ## Recursion
//!
//! Computed by least-fixpoint iteration over the whole call graph, not a
//! single top-down walk — correct for direct and mutual recursion alike
//! (`docs/LANGUAGE.md` §6: "direct and mutual recursion both work"). The
//! lattice here is finite (at most `ast::Effect`'s four tags) and every
//! iteration step only ever adds to a function's set, never removes it —
//! monotone, so the loop is guaranteed to reach a fixed point, in the
//! worst case one pass per tag.
