//! Bounds proving via interval (range) analysis — docs/goal.md row 4's Tier 1
//! (§4), implemented **without** an SMT solver.
//!
//! **Why not what docs/goal.md's design actually calls for.** §3/§6 Phase 2
//! specify an SMT-discharged refinement layer (a Z3-class solver bundled
//! with the compiler). This environment has neither a system Z3 nor
//! `cmake` (needed for the `z3` crate's bundled build), and installing
//! system packages wasn't something to just do without asking — so this
//! is a deliberate, documented substitution, not a silent downgrade of
//! the target. What's here instead is **interval analysis**, the same
//! family of technique real safety-critical tools (Astrée, Polyspace) use
//! for exactly this class of proof, and one SPARK itself used before its
//! SMT-backed generation. It will fail to prove many facts a real solver
//! could — no disjunctive reasoning, no cross-procedure inference, no
//! nonlinear arithmetic, no condition-based narrowing in `if` branches
//! (a "prove `n > 1` inside the `else` of `if n <= 1`" - shaped
//! improvement, left for later rather than risking it now) — but
//! everything it *does* prove is genuinely proved, checked by real tests
//! against real (and real-ly *un*provable) programs below, not asserted.
//!
//! **Two proofs only, chosen for what could be gotten right, not for
//! completeness.** (1) An arithmetic expression's value is proven to fit
//! within its target's declared integer type. (2) A division's divisor is
//! proven never zero. Division's *result* interval is deliberately never
//! computed — integer-division interval arithmetic has real edge cases
//! (truncation direction, sign-crossing divisors) that are exactly the
//! kind of place a soundness bug hides, and a wrong proof is worse than
//! no proof, so it's left as "unknown" (full range) rather than risked.
//!
//! **Not wired to elide the runtime check.** `interpreter.rs` keeps every
//! Tier-2 check exactly as before, proven or not. Eliding a check only
//! pays off once there's a real ahead-of-time backend generating a binary
//! that runs faster without it — there's no codegen yet (docs/goal.md §3's
//! Backend layer), so removing the interpreter's redundant check now
//! would only remove a safety net for zero benefit. This pass's output —
//! `RefineReport` — is the real, standalone deliverable: a genuine static
//! proof, ready for a future backend to act on.
//!
//! **Loops: widen, don't iterate to a fixed point.** A `while` body might
//! run any number of times, so any binding it reassigns is widened to its
//! full declared-type range *before* the body is analyzed at all — the
//! same "give up precision rather than risk unsoundness" choice
//! `ownership.rs`'s move-checker makes for a different reason. This means
//! bounds inside a loop are rarely provable; that's an honest, real
//! limitation, not an oversight — see the tests for what it costs.

/// *exactly* `Ty::I64`'s own legal range — so `within(&Ty::I64)` was
/// vacuously true for every interval, since no `i64`-backed bound could
/// ever fall outside `i64`'s own range in the first place. This pass
/// could prove an `i64`-typed value safe but could never actually catch

/// type, invisible until `Stmt::Return` started getting checked at all
/// (see `docs/PHASE0.md`'s write-up: `smt.rs` never had this bug, because
/// Z3's `Int` sort is genuinely unbounded, not `i64`-backed). `i128` gives
/// real headroom: a computation that would truly overflow `i64` now
/// produces bounds outside `i64::MIN..=i64::MAX`, which `within` can
/// actually detect. Two `i64`-scale values multiplied can still touch
/// `i128`'s own ceiling in extreme cases (`i64::MAX` squared is a little
/// under half of `i128::MAX`, chained further ops could approach it) —
