//! LLVM codegen — docs/goal.md row 5 ("native, hardware-speed codegen"),
//! started here for the first time. Emits **textual LLVM IR** and shells
//! out to the system `clang` to assemble/link a real native binary,
//! rather than binding to the LLVM C API from Rust (`inkwell`/`llvm-sys`)
//! — this environment has LLVM 22, recent enough that a Rust binding
//! crate's supported-version list might not cover it yet, and textual IR
//! sidesteps that entirely: it's a stable, documented format, and `clang`
//! on this system is *the same* LLVM 22, so there's no version-skew risk
//! between what's emitted and what assembles it. Several real compilers
//! (plenty of small production and hobby ones) use exactly this strategy.
//!
//! **Scoped to what's honestly supported, not silently narrowed.**
//! `check_supported`'s own `unsupported(...)` call sites are the
//! authoritative list of what's rejected — treat that function itself as
//! the source of truth, not this comment, which has drifted out of sync
//! with what actually compiles more than once already (see
//! `docs/LANGUAGE.md` §10's "Updated 22 Aug 2026" note for a concrete
//! example: this file's own earlier doc comment claimed `box`/`&`/`*`
//! had no codegen, when `nir_alloc`/`nir_free` (driven by
//! `ownership.rs`'s `FreeMap`) already compiled real heap alloc/free by
//! the time that claim was read again). As of this writing: every
//! scalar integer type, signed (`i8`/`i16`/`i32`/`i64`) and unsigned
//! (`u8`/`u16`/`u32`/`u64`/`usize` — `widen_to_i64`'s doc comment on why
//! unsigned needed only one small, contained change, not a parallel
//! signed/unsigned codegen path), plus `bool`, `unit`, `f64`, `str`,
//! `box`/`&`/`*`, `tcp`/`tcp_listener`, `sha256_hex`/
//! `constant_time_str_eq` (`STR_CRYPTO_BUILTINS`), and `Vector`/`Matrix`
//! (plus most of the dense-linalg/geometry/Kalman builtin surface) all
//! compile — including `print` on every one of those scalar shapes
//! (`Codegen::call`'s `Ty::Bool`/`Ty::Unit` arms handle the two that
//! used to be rejected) — and, as of Phase 4a, `struct`/`enum`/`match`
//! over **non-affine** payloads (construction, `expr.field` access, and
//! `match`'s enum-variant + literal-pattern arms). Rejected: an
//! **affine-containing** `struct`/`enum`/`match` (a `box`/`&`/`tcp`/`file`/
//! `db`/`mq` field/payload, transitively — Phase 4b; needs
//! `ownership.rs`'s `FreeMap` generalized beyond `Ty::Box`-only
//! `still_owned_boxes` plus a new `at_match_arm_end` entry), `thread`/
//! `chan`/`sandbox`/`file`/`json`/`db`/`mq`/`transact`/every Row 12
//! identity builtin, `fn(..)->..`/`acquire`/`requires(...)`, and `print`
//! on a whole `Vector`/`Matrix` argument.
//!
//! **Tier 1 vs Tier 2 finally means something.** `refine.rs` and
//! `smt.rs` both proved things and both said, explicitly, "not wired to
//! elide the runtime check — there's no backend to spend the payoff on
//! yet." There is now. A `let`/assignment whose span is in the passed-in
//! `SmtReport::proven_in_range` gets no runtime bounds check emitted at
//! all (Tier 1, silent, exactly as docs/goal.md §4 describes); one that
//! isn't gets an explicit compare-and-trap sequence in the compiled
//! binary (Tier 2, a real cost, visible in the generated IR). Same
//! distinction for division and `proven_nonzero_divisor`. This is the
//! first place in the whole codebase where a static proof actually
//! changes what runs, not just what's reported.
//!
//! **Codegen strategy: alloca everywhere, correctness over cleverness.**
//! Every parameter and every `let` gets its own stack slot
//! (`alloca`/`store`/`load`), the same strategy `clang -O0` itself uses
//! and every "toy compiler to LLVM" tutorial teaches — it's simple to
//! get right, and LLVM's own optimizer (not run here; nothing asks for
//! `-O2`) would promote these to registers anyway if it were. Allocas
//! are emitted at the point of each `let`, not hoisted to the entry
//! block: Nirdosha's scoping rules mean a name is only ever referenced
//! somewhere its `let` already dominates (you can't read a variable
//! before its declaration or from a sibling branch), so this is valid
//! LLVM IR without the hoisting pass a stricter backend might do. `&&`/
//! `||` are lowered to real conditional branches, not eager bitwise
//! `and`/`or` — short-circuit evaluation is a tested behavior
//! (`tests/basic.rs`'s short-circuit tests), and this backend has to
//! preserve it, not just the interpreter.
