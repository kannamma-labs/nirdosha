//! SMT-backed refinement checking — the Tier-1 pass docs/goal.md §3/§6 Phase 2
//! actually specifies (an SMT-discharged refinement layer), using a real
//! Z3 (linked against the system library via the `z3` crate) now that
//! this environment has one. This **supersedes `refine.rs`'s interval
//! analysis** as the primary Tier-1 checker — `refine.rs` stays in the
//! tree deliberately, not deleted, as the documented fallback for an
//! environment without Z3 available (see its module doc); its design
//! reasoning doesn't stop being correct just because a stronger solver
//! showed up.
//!
//! **What SMT actually buys, demonstrated by the tests below, not just
//! claimed:**
//! - **Condition-based narrowing.** Entering the `else` of `if n <= 1
//!   {...} else {...}`, this pass asserts `!(n <= 1)` into the solver
//!   before checking anything inside — so `n > 1` is genuinely known
//!   there, for free. `refine.rs` structurally cannot do this (interval
//!   analysis has no way to represent "this variable's value depends on
//!   a boolean condition holding").
//! - **Correlated-variable reasoning.** Z3 tracks exact symbolic
//!   relationships between variables (via equalities asserted at each
//!   `let`), not just each variable's independent range — so it can
//!   prove facts interval analysis's per-variable bounds lose entirely
//!   (e.g. `a - b` where a prior branch establishes `a >= b`).
//!
//! **What didn't change just because the solver got stronger.** Same two
//! proof targets as `refine.rs`, for the same reasons:
//! 1. An arithmetic expression's value fits its declared target type.
//! 2. A division's divisor is never zero.
//!
//! Division's *result* value is still not modeled as a symbolic term at
//! all (division isn't asserted as an equality the way +/-/* are) —
//! that decision in `refine.rs` was about avoiding integer-truncation
//! edge cases, not about solver power, so a stronger solver doesn't
//! change the reasoning. No interprocedural summaries either: a call's
//! result is a fresh symbolic value bounded only by the callee's
//! declared return type, same limitation, same reason (no per-function
//! pre/postcondition inference exists yet).
//!
//! **Loops:** same conservative choice as `refine.rs` — any variable the
//! loop body reassigns becomes a fresh, only-bounds-constrained symbolic
//! value before the loop is analyzed at all, rather than attempting loop
//! invariant synthesis. That's not a shortcut unique to this project:
//! SPARK itself requires the *programmer* to write loop invariants for
//! exactly this reason — automatically inferring them is a genuinely
//! larger undertaking than this pass, or most refinement-type systems
//! without an invariant-inference research component, attempt.
//!
//! **Not wired to elide the interpreter's runtime check** — same
//! reasoning as `refine.rs`: there's no backend yet to spend a Tier-1
//! proof's performance payoff on, so the redundant runtime check stays.
