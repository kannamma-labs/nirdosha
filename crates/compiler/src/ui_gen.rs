//! `emit-ui` — derives a self-contained, styled web UI directly from a
//! program's `struct` declarations and its CRUD-shaped function naming
//! convention, with Row 12 identity types (`VerifiedIdentity`/`RoleView`)
//! driving login and role-gated visibility. See `docs/LANGUAGE.md`'s §2 (types)
//! and §"Identity / relying party" for the source vocabulary this reads.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! This module does the minimum Rust-side work needed to *derive the
//! shape* of the UI (`Screen`/`FieldSpec`/`Action`, below) from the typed
//! AST, then serializes that shape as a JSON "manifest" embedded in the
//! generated HTML. A small generic JS renderer (baked into the template,
//! not generated per-struct) reads the manifest and builds nav/tables/
//! forms/login at runtime. This keeps the Rust side proportional to the
//! *rules* ("what maps to what"), not to the number of structs/fields any
//! given program happens to declare.
//!
//! ## v1 scope (see the `emit-ui` plan)
//!
//! No server ships here — generated `fetch()` calls hit
//! `${API_BASE}/<fn_name>` (default `/api`, overridable via
//! `window.NIRDOSHA_API_BASE`) against whatever JSON API the user points
//! the file at. Login is an explicit client-side **stub**: it collects a
//! token, stores a mock identity/role list in `localStorage`, and gates
//! nav/actions against it — not real `oidc_validate_token` verification.
//! File upload and realtime are out of scope. A struct-typed field/param
//! expands one level deep into its own fields (the common `create_<S>(x:
//! S)` convention); a reference to a *zero-payload-only* enum (`enum
//! Status { Draft, Active }`, the categorical/ordinal case) renders as a
//! searchable dropdown, options in declaration order; a payload-carrying
//! enum, or anything deeper than the nesting cap, still renders read-only
//! (see `build_field`).
//!
//! Two more conventions besides struct/CRUD, both driven purely by
//! function name prefix + return type (`Metric`, `build_stats`/
//! `build_charts`): a zero-arg `stat_<name>() -> i64|f64` becomes a
//! dashboard tile, and a zero-arg `chart_<name>() -> json` (expected to
//! resolve to `{label, value}[]` — `db_query`'s own row shape when SQL
//! aliases its columns that way) becomes an inline-SVG bar chart. Both
//! land together on a synthetic "Dashboard" nav entry, first in the nav,
//! only when at least one exists.
//!
//! ## Declared `screen`/`dashboard` blocks (Row 12, docs/LANGUAGE.md §11)
//!
//! Everything above is pure inference — no syntax needed. `screen
//! <Struct> { ... }`/`dashboard { ... }` are an **optional, additive**
//! layer on top of it, for the handful of things a naming convention
//! can't express: a friendlier title, a relabeled field, a custom action
//! beyond plain create/update/delete. `find_screen_decl` looks up the
//! declared block (if any) for a given struct; `build_screens` consults
//! it *after* running the same inference as before, overriding only
//! what the block actually mentions (title, per-field `label`, which fn
//! backs a CRUD slot, extra `action`s) — a struct with no matching
//! `ScreenDecl` renders exactly as it did before this DSL existed. See
//! `ast::ScreenDecl`/`ast::DashboardDecl` for the typechecked shape
//! (`typeck.rs::check_screen`/`check_dashboard` validate struct/field/fn
//! references and `view`/`edit` visibility exprs before this module ever
//! sees them) and `crates/compiler/UI_DSL_TODO.md` for what's parsed/
//! typechecked but not yet wired into the generated UI (pagination,
//! search, sort, form insert/update modes). Field-level `view`/`edit`
//! RBAC (`field <name> { view: role(...), edit: role(...) } }`) *is*
//! now enforced, both here (`GatedField`/`field_gates_for_fn`/
//! `field_gates_for_struct`/`update_gates_for_fn`, consumed by the
//! client-side hiding/disabling in `ui_gen_template.html` and, for the
//! actual security boundary, by `serve.rs`'s response redaction and
//! write rejection) — see those functions' own doc comments.
