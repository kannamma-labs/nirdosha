//! Static type checker — runs before the interpreter ever sees the program.
//! This is the milestone flagged at the end of Phase 0: ownership analysis
//! and refinement types (docs/goal.md rows 1, 4) both need a fully-typed AST to
//! work over, and until now nothing built one ahead of time — the old
//! interpreter checked types *as it executed*, which is Python's discipline,
//! not the one docs/goal.md asks for.
//!
//! Design notes worth keeping visible, not just in commit history:
//!
//! - **Error recovery, not fail-fast.** A mismatch is recorded and checking
//!   continues with a poison type (`Ty::Error`) standing in for the bad
//!   expression, so one mistake doesn't hide the next five behind it. A
//!   compiler that stops at the first error is a worse interface for an
//!   agent's self-repair loop (docs/goal.md row 9) than one that reports
//!   everything it can see in one pass.
//! - **Integer literals are flexible, declared variables are not.** `n - 1`
//!   type-checks against whatever `n`'s declared width is; two variables of
//!   *different* declared widths do not implicitly convert to each other —
//!   that's docs/goal.md §3's "no implicit conversions" core-language rule,
//!   actually enforced here for the first time (the interpreter alone never
//!   enforced it, since every `Ty` collapses to the same `Value::Int(i64)`
//!   at runtime).
//! - **`if` used as a statement doesn't need its branches to agree in
//!   type; `if` used as a value does.** `if c { count = count + 1 }` with
//!   no `else`, appearing as a bare statement, is not an error — nothing
//!   reads its value. `let x: i32 = if c { 1 } else { 2 }` requires both
//!   branches to produce `i32`, and requires an `else` to exist at all.
//!   Conflating these two positions would make this checker reject
//!   `examples/loop.nir`, which is exactly why the distinction is
//!   load-bearing, not decorative.
//! - **`return` can appear inside a value-position `if`.** `let x: i32 =
//!   if c { return 5 } else { 10 }` is legal — the interpreter already
//!   runs it correctly (a `return` unwinds the whole function regardless
//!   of where it's nested; see `interpreter.rs`'s `Signal`). The checker
//!   has to thread the function's declared return type through *every*
//!   value position, not just statement position, or it would be either
//!   unsound (accepting a `return` of the wrong type) or, worse,
//!   inconsistent with what the interpreter actually does — rejecting
//!   programs that run correctly. `expected_ret` is threaded everywhere
//!   below for exactly this reason.
//! - **Definite-return analysis.** A function declared to return non-`unit`
//!   must, this pass proves, hit a `return` on every path — not "at
//!   runtime it happened to." That's a real static property, checked
//!   structurally over `if`/`else` (see `definitely_returns`), the same
//!   shape as Rust's or Java's version of the same check.
//! - **`Ty` values are threaded by reference (`&Ty`), not by value.**
//!   `Ty::Box` made `Ty` non-`Copy` (see ast.rs), and `expected_ret`/`want`
//!   get passed into nearly every function here — cloning at each hop
//!   would be needless allocation on every recursive call for no benefit,
//!   since nothing here ever needs to *own* an expected type, only read it.
