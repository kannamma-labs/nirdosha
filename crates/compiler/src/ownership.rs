//! Static move-checker — docs/goal.md row 1's actual content ("no GC, no manual
//! `free()`"). Runs after `typeck.rs`, over the same AST.
//!
//! **Why this doesn't matter for *this* interpreter's safety, and why it's
//! built anyway.** `interpreter.rs` clones a `Value` on every variable
//! read (`Env::get`), so right now, aliasing a `box` can't actually corrupt
//! anything — two "owners" just end up with two independent Rust-owned
//! trees. A real (future, LLVM-compiled, arena/region-based) backend
//! wouldn't clone; it would hand out the same address twice, and a
//! use-after-move would be a real dangling pointer or double-free. This
//! pass proves, statically, that no well-typed Nirdosha program ever does
//! that — the proof a real backend needs already exists before there's a
//! real backend to need it, which is the honest way to read "row 1 is
//! partially done": the discipline is proved, not yet load-bearing.
//!
//! **The rule.** Every type is either *affine* (`Ty::is_affine` — currently
//! only `Ty::Box`) or freely copyable (everything else). Using an
//! affine-typed variable **by name** — as a `let` initializer, an
//! assignment RHS, a call argument, a `return` value — transfers ownership
//! out of that variable; any later use of the same variable (on the same
//! control-flow path) is a "use after move" error. Reading *through* a box
//! (`*b`) moves it only when what comes out is itself affine — `*b` for
//! `b: box i64` copies a scalar out and leaves `b` valid, but `*bb` for
//! `bb: box box i64` hands out the inner `box i64` by value, so *that*
//! does consume `bb` (see the `Expr::Deref` arm of `touch_expr` for the
//! type-directed check this needs — it was originally written as an
//! unconditional exemption and only caught during testing that nested
//! boxes made that unsound; the fix and the reasoning are both there).
//!
//! **Branches merge, conservatively.** After `if c { moves b } else {
//! doesn't }`, `b` has to be treated as moved either way — the checker
//! can't know at compile time which branch ran, so it assumes the worse
//! one, the same as Rust's own borrow checker does. See `merge_moved`.
//!
//! **Known limitation: no place-expression semantics, so `&box T` is
//! borrow-only, not read-through.** `*r` for `r: &box i64` denotes the
//! `box i64` itself — extracting it is correctly rejected as a move out
//! of a shared reference (`typeck.rs`'s `CannotMoveOutOfReference`),
//! since you don't own what's behind a `&`. But that means there is
//! currently *no way* to read the scalar inside a box reached only
//! through a reference — `**r` doesn't help, because the inner `*r` hits
//! the same rejection before the outer `*` ever runs. Real Rust avoids
//! this with place-expression semantics: `**r` reads straight through
//! both layers in one composed operation, never treating the
//! intermediate `Box` as a value that has to be moved out on its own.
//! Building that properly is real, additional work (tracking whether an
//! expression denotes a *place* vs. a *value*, the way a MIR-based
//! borrow checker does) that this increment doesn't attempt — `&box T`
//! is honestly borrow-and-pass-around-only for now, not read-through.
//! Reading a box's content still works fine through an *owned* box (the
//! existing `box`/`*` tests), just not through a `&` to one.
//!
//! **Loops get checked twice.** A `while` body might run more than once,
//! and a variable the body moves on iteration 1 is gone by iteration 2 —
//! checking the body only once, from the state *before* the loop, would
//! miss that entirely (this was caught while writing this module: the
//! first draft's single-pass version would have accepted `while cond { let
//! c = b; use(c); }` even though the second iteration re-reads an already-
//! moved `b`). The fix: check the body once, silently, to see what state
//! one iteration produces; merge that with the pre-loop state (the loop
//! might run 0 or more times); then check the body *again*, for real, from
//! that merged state. This is a sound approximation, not a full fixed
//! point — a body that only becomes movable after two-or-more prior
//! iterations could theoretically still slip through — documented here as
//! a known limitation rather than silently assumed away.
