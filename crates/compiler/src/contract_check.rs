//! Tier-1 contract checking — `docs/API_TRUST_MODEL.md` §7.5's proposed
//! extension to `smt.rs`, built out for real. §7.5 named exactly what
//! was missing before this file existed: "nothing anywhere accepts a
//! predicate *written by a human or a story extractor* as input" —
//! `smt.rs` only ever proves obligations it synthesizes itself while
//! walking a `let`/division/index. This is that missing obligation
//! channel: given a real `.nir` function and a Hoare predicate string
//! (a user story's `pre_logic`/`post_logic`, or a `workflow`'s
//! `routing_fn` contract — exactly the shape
//! `scratch/extracted_typed_v1.json` carries), either prove the
//! predicate holds for *every* input the function's declared parameter
//! types admit, or produce a concrete counterexample.
//!
//! **Scope, deliberately narrow — the same boundary §7.5 already named,
//! not loosened here:** integer parameters and an integer return value
//! only (no `f64`, no `bool` return, no `struct`/`enum`); no loops, no
//! calls, no division (truncation semantics would need separate,
//! careful modeling — the same reason `smt.rs` never asserts division's
//! *result* as an equality either); no interprocedural reasoning (a
//! predicate can only talk about the one function's own params/return).
//! Anything outside that shape is `Unsupported`, reported honestly, not
//! silently approximated — approximating an unmodelable sub-expression
//! with a fresh unconstrained value would be sound for a *proof*
//! (over-approximation only ever weakens what can be proven) but
//! **unsound for a counterexample** (a "violation" built partly out of a
//! meaningless free variable might not correspond to any real input/
//! output of the function at all) — so this walker aborts the moment it
//! can't model something, on both sides.
//!
//! **The `high_value_threshold` case, and why `extra_bindings`
//! exists.** `scratch/extracted_typed_v1.json`'s `WF-TRDPAY-001.
//! routing_fn.post_logic` is `"(result == 2) == (amount_cents >=
//! high_value_threshold)"` — but the real `required_eyes_for_amount`
//! (`examples/trade-finance/trade_finance.nir`) takes only
//! `amount_cents`; `high_value_threshold` isn't one of its parameters,
//! it's a PRD concept the code hardcodes as a literal. §7.1a already
//! named this exact gap: a story's predicate and the code's actual
//! parameterization can disagree about what's a variable and what's a
//! constant. Rather than silently treating `high_value_threshold` as
//! either "any value" (which would make the predicate unprovable for a
//! reason that has nothing to do with the code being wrong) or "some
//! value nobody chose," `check_fn_contract` requires the caller to
//! supply a concrete value for every such name via `extra_bindings` —
//! `UnboundIdentifier` is the honest result when they don't, naming
//! exactly the missing piece instead of a confusing SMT failure.
