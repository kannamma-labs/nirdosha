//! Machine-checkable form of `US-TRDPAY-002`'s acceptance criteria
//! (scratch/extracted_userstories_v2.json — "Automatic Risk-Based
//! Governance Routing at Payment Initiation"), whose `post_logic` states
//! `routed_to_six_eyes == (payment_amount > high_value_threshold)`.
//!
//! `.nir` has no general Hoare-style `requires`/`ensures` — `requires(...)`
//! is RBAC-only (docs/LANGUAGE.md §6a). So this predicate isn't checked by a
//! contract annotation; it's checked by actually running the real
//! `.nir` routing rule (mirrored here from
//! `examples/trade-finance/trade_finance.nir:1733-1735`'s
//! `required_eyes_for_amount`, since that file's own `fn main() {}` and
//! DB-backed dependencies make it unusable as an `include_str!` test
//! entry point — same reason `constant_time_str_eq.rs` inlines its own
//! minimal `.nir` snippets rather than including the real file) through
//! `nirdosha::run` and asserting on the returned `Value`.
//!
//! `nir_scenario!`'s Given/When/Then grammar is enforced by `rustc` at
//! compile time (wrong keyword order, or a `Then` whose type doesn't
//! match `Value`, is a compile error) — but that only covers the Rust
//! harness shape. The `.nir` logic inside `when` is parsed/type-checked
//! by Nirdosha's own `typeck` when the test *runs*, not by `rustc` when
//! the crate builds; a malformed `.nir` scenario fails a `#[test]`, it
//! doesn't fail `cargo build`.
//!
//! Two discrepancies against the PRD-derived story surfaced while
//! writing these, both left as-is (not "fixed" here) since only a human
//! call can settle which side — the doc's example or the shipped
//! `.nir` rule — is authoritative:
//! 1. Threshold value: the story's GWTs use "$1,000,000" as illustrative
//!    (its own module excerpt hedges "e.g."); the shipped rule uses
//!    $50,000 (5,000,000 cents) — flagged in `trade_finance.nir`'s own
//!    comment as "a fixed illustrative cutoff" pending per-tenant config.
//!    These scenarios test the shipped $50,000 figure, not the story's.
//! 2. Boundary operator: the story's `post_logic` and its second GWT
//!    ("at or below the configured threshold" -> Maker-Checker) both
//!    imply a strict `>` for six-eyes, i.e. exactly-at-threshold should
//!    be Maker-Checker. The shipped rule uses `>=`, i.e.
//!    exactly-at-threshold is six-eyes. `boundary_case` below asserts
//!    the shipped `>=` behavior (six-eyes at exactly the threshold), the
//!    opposite of what the story's prose says — a real spec/code mismatch,
//!    not a test bug.
